    <description><![CDATA[Back in the 1967-68 school year, when I was in third grade, I remember this cartoon appearing in an educational circular the teacher would pass out each week or so and go over with the class.
The character appearing in your clips here, with the glasses and bow tie, was there...but the only other character that appeared with him was a large but juvenile hippopotamus wearing overalls. In the final frame when a punchline was delivered one of the buttons fastening the shoulder straps of his overalls would pop.
Does this character ring a bell in regards to this strip?]]></description>
