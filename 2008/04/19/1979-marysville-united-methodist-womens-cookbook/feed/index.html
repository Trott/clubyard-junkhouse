    <description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve make the pretzel jello salad several times.. got the recipe from a freinds grandmother after I tried it at a party.. it&#039;s FANTASTIC if you like salt and sweet which I do.  (why they call it salad, I have NO idea.. it&#039;s a dessert bar)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This truly is a treasure, isn&#039;t it swankola? I can&#039;t wait to see what these salads look like. How often do you actually make the recipes in your cookbooks?

Ugh -- the Watergate Salad uses the metallic syrup leftover from draining the pineapple as the liquid for the pistachio pudding. Do they still make those multi-colored miniature marshmallows? God, I hope so.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Although the Spinach Salad (along with a few others like the Fisherman&#039;s Wharf Cioppino Salad and the 24 Hour Tossed Salad) is sadly lacking in gelatin, I note that it does have the virtue of containing &quot;P-Nut oil.&quot;  Meanwhile, the Watergate Salad has no gelatin but has instant pudding instead!  That, plus the audacity of naming anything &quot;Watergate&quot; in 1979 makes that one a must for anyone seriously aspiring to make bad salads.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Don&#039;t make the spinach salad - it&#039;s got spinach in it (and not even frozen spinach).

As a cookbook collector I&#039;m very jealous. This book reminds me of my old Newfoundland cookbooks; in one, the salad section is 2 recipes - one being pineapple cole slaw and the other a sandwich filling of corned beef, shredded cabbage and pickle relish.]]></description>
