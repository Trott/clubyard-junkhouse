		<description><![CDATA[The old Town &amp; Country mini-malls have great big signs that look just like those lamps, too -- I tried to get a picture of one the other day, but it came out blurry. 

Driving around looking at midcentury buildings &amp; signage is one of my very most favoritest things -- and a big part of why I love Los Angeles so much. We should all go on a driving tour of Los Angeles together some time.

Ah, Pollardville, we hardly knew ye....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey ive seen some of these places before!  i always thought i was the odd duck in that, i can be an incredibly cheap date by just driving me around the suburbs and looking at signage at apts/theaters/etc.  

hey, and speaking of those lamps you like, there are a few they are selling right now at pollardville.  they are freaking gigantic, and even have ones that are painted in a crazy french motif (red white and blue colored glass and such, and they are at least 3 feet high).  

anyway...*sniff sniff*, pollardville closes tomorrow.  :(]]></description>
