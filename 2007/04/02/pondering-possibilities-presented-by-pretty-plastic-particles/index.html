      <div class="entry">
        <p>So, the other day, I became temporarily obsessed with these little plastic nuggets:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="../../../../images/just-one-word-plastics.jpg" alt="Just one word. Plastics." title="Just one word. Plastics." height=305 width=500 /><br />
Just one word. Plastics.</div>
<p>I have fond childhood memories of filling up little metal frames with these plastic bits and melting them in the oven to make stained-glass suncatchers. But for the life of me, I couldn&#8217;t remember what the heck they were called. A lot of Googling time only brought up a company that makes <a href="http://www.judaism.com/search.asp?itemtype=&#038;nt=DH&#038;keyword=stained+glass+kit">Jewish-themed ones</a>, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t making stained-glass dreidels and menorahs when I was a kid. It was more like mushrooms and butterflies and frogs &#8212; y&#8217;know, good &#8217;70s stuff. Just when I was ready to give up, I found &#8216;em &#8212; they&#8217;re <a href="http://colorbok.com/DeptFiles/mandb.aspx?PageType=2&#038;RecordID=385">Makit &#038; Bakits</a>. And they&#8217;re still making them! </p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/kindergarten-level-glazier.jpg" alt="Kindergarten-level glazier" title="Kindergarten-level glazier" height=261 width=200 /><br />
Kindergarten-level glazier</div>
<p>Well, that meant a jaunt to my friendly neighborhood craft store was in order. Sure enough, there was a very small selection of kits. They even make glow-in-the-dark ones now. I had to buy one. I picked out this little flower one, just because the colors were more interesting than the ones in the other sets. It rang up at $1.35 (!). It was definitely at least $2, maybe even $3, worth of fun. That&#8217;s value, my friends. </p>
<p>I cheated and mixed the colors on the petals, because I like it when the nuggets blend together like that. I&#8217;m happy enough with how it turned out, but I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do with it; it will probably live a prostrate and nomadic life, moving about the house from one flat surface to another along with random scraps of papers and other doodads, until I throw it out.</p>
<p>So, now what? Here&#8217;s what &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a whole mess of those little plastic nuggets left. They seem to have designed these kits to come with enough pellets to recover from a spill onto the particle abyss that was a &#8217;70s shag carpet. I think I might actually somehow have more of these plastic bits than I started with. It&#8217;s the melting of the plastic bits that&#8217;s the most fun with these &#8212; the frames are kind of ass &#8212; so I can&#8217;t just throw these out, I&#8217;ve got to melt them. But how? In what shape?</p>
<p>My current thinking is that I want to lay them out in a disc shape and melt them, and then, while they&#8217;re still warm, shape them into a little bowl. Kind of like they do on television cooking shows with grated parmesan. But I can&#8217;t help but think that this is worth pondering a little bit more.</p>
<p>Got any ideas?</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you for naming this craft!  You saved me from hours of Google search.  My daughter was gifted with one of these and we lost the directions.  My suggestion for your plastic bits is to use an old canning jar lid (the band, not the actual lid) as your frame.  Might do that myself with our leftovers!  <img src='http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I was just looking for something along this line. My thought was using them in wood turning bowls. Cut a grove in a wood bowl fill it with the bits CA glue them it sand them down to a high gloss and bingo. I seen this done with rock chips and it is a lot harder to sand flat. How big is one bit? my guess is 1/8&#8243; Dia. X 3/16&#8243; long.<br />
