        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is simply outstanding:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CJn_jC4FNDo" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />
A Fair(y) Use Tale, by Eric Faden</div>
<p>This is <a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/documentary-film-program/film/a-fair-y-use-tale">a short film, by Eric Faden</a>, illustrating how copyright and fair use work (and more importantly, how they <i>don&#8217;t</i> work). What makes it exceptionally clever is that it is completely composed of short snippets of Disney animated films. Not only is Disney notoriously thorough in their defense of their intellectual property (as is their right), they have thrown immense lobbying dollars and efforts into getting the term of copyright extended (which kinda stinks).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that the music used in this piece is <i>not</i> from Disney, and has been used with permission. After you&#8217;ve viewed this clip, you&#8217;ll understand why &#8212; the music does not play a role in parody, or in teaching, and would not have fallen under fair use. If the subject of the clip was the fair use specifically of <i>music</i>, then the use of music as illustration could possibly have been supported.</p>
<p>I have this come up all the time, when my website clients ask about using music on their websites. This clip does a better job of explaining it all than I have done in the past (and I learned a bit about fair use while watching it, too). I&#8217;m so glad I can now point my clients to this to answer some of their questions about copyright and fair use.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My favorite part of Walt Disney World is Epcot&#8217;s World Showcase, which houses mini-lands representing eleven different countries, each one themed to the hilt. I couldn&#8217;t possibly pick a favorite pavilion, but if someone <i>really</i> pressed me, Mexico would definitely be in the running.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/epcots-mexico-pavilion.jpg" alt="Epcot's Mexico Pavilion" title="Epcot's Mexico Pavilion" height=332 width=500 /><br />
Epcot&#8217;s Mexico Pavilion</div>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/mariachi-cobre.jpg" alt="Mariachi Cobre" title="Mariachi Cobre" height=188 width=250 /><br />
Mariachi Cobre</div>
<p>First off, the music is fantastic. I <i>love</i> mariachi music, absolutely nuts for the stuff. Nothing is better on a sunny day, and no other music can so reliably put a smile on my face. The band that plays at Epcot is Mariachi Cobre. It was a surreal moment when I first visited the Mexico pavilion and saw that they play there daily &#8212; I have all their albums, and had no idea they were a Disney band. Definitely one of those moments that affirmed my love for Disney.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s lit perfectly and romantically &#8212; it&#8217;s always twilight in the Mexico pavilion. It&#8217;s the only pavilion that is completely indoors, which can be awfully nice when it gets too hot in the Florida sun. It&#8217;s only a little bit brighter than a Peppermill&#8217;s. I am an absolute sucker for a dimly lit public establishment. It&#8217;s the best way to make a place feel totally immersive. I don&#8217;t exactly feel like I&#8217;m in Mexico when I&#8217;m inside the Mexico pavilion, but I know I&#8217;m somewhere unreal and magical.</p>
<p>The restaurant in the pavilion is the San Angel Inn. In short, it&#8217;s a Mexican-themed Blue Bayou. It sits at the back of the pavilion, overlooking an Aztec pyramid, with a volcano rumbling threateningly in the distance. The food isn&#8217;t spectacular, but it&#8217;s good, and the margaritas are actually great. It&#8217;s not my favorite restaurant at Walt Disney World (there&#8217;s so much great food to be had there), but it&#8217;s worth making time for.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/pyramid-and-volcano-in-the-dista.jpg" alt="Pyramid and volcano in the distance at San Angel Inn" title="Pyramid and volcano in the distance at San Angel Inn" height=303 width=500 /><br />
Pyramid and volcano in the distance at San Angel Inn</div>
<p>Running between the San Angel Inn and that pyramid, just like at the Blue Bayou restaurant in Disneyland, is a water-based dark ride. But no blockbuster films will ever be made in tribute to El Rio del Tiempo.</p>
<p>However, a <i>non</i>-blockbuster film has been made&#8230; RU42 has created an 11 minute tribute to this pavilion, including a run-through of El Rio del Tiempo:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/RZ-YiSAVf8k"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/RZ-YiSAVf8k" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />
The Mexico Pavilion, featuring El Rio del Tiempo, by RU41</div>
<p>El Rio del Tiempo shall forever live in infamy. It was the only ride in all of World Showcase when the pavilion opened in 1982 (Norway&#8217;s Maelstrom ride was added in 1988). The true experience of it defies description, but I&#8217;m going to try anyhow. </p>
<p>As the ride begins, your boat heads past that pyramid and volcano, and into an ancient temple. For some reason, there are video screens projecting images from a 1982 disco party, with star fields &#038; rainbows, and possibly the Village People. You turn the corner, and now you&#8217;re on the It&#8217;s a Small Mexico ride, only all the children have killed Mary Blair. Then you&#8217;re in modern-day Mexico&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, you&#8217;re in <i>1982</i> Mexico&#8230; and you&#8217;re visiting a tourism office. There are video scenes of beaches and cliff divers, and a hot tub party. &#8220;1982 Hot Tub Party.&#8221; Just let that sink in for a little bit, and see if you don&#8217;t feel like you could use a shower. From there, it&#8217;s El Rio del Tiempo&#8217;s most notorious section: the open-air market. You boat is chased &#8212; <i>chased</i> &#8212; by desperate merchants, begging you to buy their merchandise. Then you head into a room that has Mexico City&#8217;s 1982 skyline all lit up on one side, and marionnettes forced to dance eternally in a carousel-like circle. Marionnettes are always a little creepy, but these are <i>full-size human</i> marionnettes, which just exaggerates their soullessness. Fireworks are exploding overhead, just in case you weren&#8217;t uncomfortable enough with the scene as it is. And then you see the painting of Mexico that signals you will soon be free.</p>

<p>El Rio del Tiempo closed recently, and has been updated; it&#8217;s now called Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros. This is a wonderful development &#8212; Three Caballeros is my favorite Disney film, and a perfect fit. I can&#8217;t wait to see the new ride. (<b>PLEASE do not tell me anything you might know about the new ride. I&#8217;m trying to remain unspoiled.</b>) While I don&#8217;t doubt for a second that they did the right thing in updating this ride, I am a little wistful that I won&#8217;t get to ride it again. I kind of loved it.</p>
<p>Happy Cinco de Mayo!</p>

Boomerang</div>
<p>Just when you think that the Internet holds all the answers, it fails you. My search for information about Boomerang, a &#8217;70s kids&#8217; TV show from my native Seattle, has turned up nearly bupkes.</p>
<p>I did learn something very interesting&#8230; I had no idea that Marni, the host of Boomerang, was none other than <a href="http://adf.ly/CGdsR ">Marni Nixon</a>. </p>
<p>Nixon is the reason Julie Andrews won her Oscar for Mary Poppins. Well, that&#8217;s not fair &#8212; that was a well-earned Oscar. (Those who already know this story can skip ahead a couple of paragraphs.) Julie Andrews had starred on Broadway in the hit musical My Fair Lady, and won a Tony award. But when My Fair Lady was turned into a Hollywood film, Julie Andrews was not yet a name movie-goers would recognize, and Warner Brothers cast Audrey Hepburn in what really should have been Julie Andrews&#8217; role. Walt Disney knew better, and cast Andrews that same year in Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins, and Julie Andrews, became a smash sensation. </p>
<p>When the press started to dig a bit, and learned that Audrey Hepburn didn&#8217;t actually sing her parts &#8212; that the beautiful voice behind &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Loverly&#8221; and &#8220;I Could Have Danced All Night&#8221; was actually Marni Nixon&#8230; well, Jack Warner started to look like a fool for having ditched Julie Andrews. In Julie Andrews&#8217; Oscar acceptance speech for Mary Poppins, she thanked &#8220;the man who made this all possible&#8230; Jack Warner,&#8221; which makes me love Julie Andrews even more. </p>
<p>Marni actually has a brief role in Mary Poppins, as one of the animated geese, but didn&#8217;t meet Andrews while working on that film. When Nixon and Andrews later worked together on The Sound of Music (Nixon played one of the nuns), Andrews introduced herself with a hearty handshake, and exclaimed &#8220;I really love your work!,&#8221; probably with a cheeky look in her eye. Marni also was the singing voice for Maria in West Side Story, and she did some vocal work for a Mr. Magoo album, &#8220;Magoo in Hi-Fi&#8221; and provided &#8220;ethereal voice effects&#8221; for some Esquivel albums. She was a very, very successful session singer in Hollywood.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still having trouble reconciling the host of Boomerang with this Hollywood figure, but it comes together a bit when I hear the Boomerang theme song again &#8212; the song&#8217;s not exactly a winner, but it sure brings back memories, and that voice is loverly:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/audio/boomerang.mp3">Download audio file (boomerang.mp3)</a><br /><br />
Click play to hear the Boomerang theme song</div>
<p>This still leaves plenty of holes about Boomerang the show, though. I can fill in a little bit more from my own memories: It aired on channel 4, KOMO, which was Seattle&#8217;s ABC affiliate. It was filmed during the late &#8217;70s into the early &#8217;80s, and continued on in reruns for a while. Marni&#8217;s co-star was a yellow puppet boy, who looked like a cross between Bert from Sesame Street and Terrence from South Park. <strike>I can&#8217;t remember his name, and I couldn&#8217;t find it online.</strike> His name was Norbert. (Thanks melberoo!) There&#8217;s one episode in particular that I remember, where Marni was hired to do a commercial for some silver polish, but she tries the polish and it doesn&#8217;t work very well, and she decides to not do the commercial. It was a lesson about not whoring oneself out, and whenever I&#8217;m faced with similar scenarios, I always think of Marni&#8217;s frustration with the silver polish. Overall, the show was on the schmaltzy side, and if we&#8217;d had the variety of cable back then, I probably would never have watched it.</p>
<p>So anywhere, there you go. That&#8217;s all I could find about the Seattle show Boomerang. Maybe someday something more will show up.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I would like to discuss one of the true classics of the Disney live action canon: <i>Monkeys, Go Home!</i> This 1967 film has it <i>all</i>&#8230; monkeys* &#8212; four of them, and they&#8217;re &lt;dramatic echo&gt;SPACE MONKEYS&lt;/dramatic echo&gt; &#8230; Dean Jones &#8230; &#8217;60s protests &#8230; Love, Frenchy Style &#8230; and as if that weren&#8217;t enough (no, stop! no, really!) &#8230; <i>Maurice! Chevalier!</i> And! The! Title! Ends! In! An! Exclamation! Point! Can you feel the hilarity?! So zany!!!</p>
<p><i>*phew*</i> &#8230; I&#8217;ll take it down a notch or two now, before someone reaches through the screen to throttle me.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/dean-jones-puts-his-chimps-to-wo.jpg" alt="Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney's &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;" title="Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney's &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;" height=378 width=500 /><br />
Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney&#8217;s &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;</div>
<p>Alright now, where was I? Oh yes. Monkeys, Go Home. I mean, Monkeys, Go Home!. In this delightful, fun for <strike>the whole family</strike> maybe some of the family film, Dean Jones plays Henry Dussard, an American who has just inherited an olive farm he has never seen, in the south of France. Ooh la la! Being an American, he&#8217;s got some nutty ideas about how to turn this olive farm into a profitable venture &#8212; by hiring chimps instead of people to work the farm. Luckily, he previously was a chimp trainer for NASA, so he&#8217;s got a team of recently-retired space chimps at his disposal. So wacky!</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/in-the-60s-even-the-chimps-wer.jpg" alt="In the '60s, even the chimps were protesting" title="In the '60s, even the chimps were protesting" height=377 width=500 /><br />
In the &#8217;60s, even the chimps were protesting</div>
<p>The little French town doesn&#8217;t like the idea of having to compete against a chimp-run farm, and they mount an underground resistance against Dussard. The chimps strike back by mounting a protest of their own, fighting for their right to work just as humans do. At the same time, a boozy French broad shows up claiming to be Dussard&#8217;s long-lost cousin (and she is truly fabulous, played by Yvonne Constant), staking claim to half of Dussard&#8217;s farm, and threatening Dussard&#8217;s budding relationship with a barely-legal French tartlet, played by Yvette Mimieux. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/maurice-chevalier-with-the-fren.jpg" alt="Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It's a Small World" title="Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It's a Small World" height=377 width=500 /><br />
Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It&#8217;s a Small World</div>
<p>And just for good measure, Maurice Chevalier plays the town priest, who shows up now and then to impart some heavily-accented wisdom, and sing a song or two.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hukoti-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B00006675V&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=8F5E11&#038;bc1=FFFFFF&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr&#038;nou=1" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>This is quite possibly the slapstickiest, monkeyest, wacknuttiest of all the Disney films. The hilarity, it ensues. This film&#8230; well, it&#8217;s sort of the Disney version of the Star Wars Holiday Special. I can&#8217;t help but wonder why they&#8217;ve released it on DVD, but I&#8217;m so glad they did. I kind of love it. </p>
<p>Oh! The music! The music is the best part, and I&#8217;m not kidding around here &#8212; I would sincerely buy Robert F. Brunner&#8217;s soundtrack/score. It&#8217;s great &#8217;60s light-quirk-funk-pop stuff.</p>
<p><small>* Technically, chimps aren&#8217;t monkeys, but for the sake of simplicity, today we&#8217;ll say they are. It&#8217;s Topsy-Turvy day! Shrimp are fish! Tomatoes are vegetables! Mama&#8217;s Family was funny!</small></p>

<p> The great Disney blog <a href="http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-character-ranger-j-audubon.html">2719 Hyperion</a> has a wonderful post about one of my favorite overlooked Disney characters J. Audubon Woodlore, the park ranger. I fell in love with him as a kid when I saw the classic &#8220;In The Bag&#8221;, where he makes up a little song and dance to convince the bears to clean up the park. Apparently In The Bag was such a hit that it inspired a record called the &#8220;Humphrey Hop.&#8221; </p>

<p>The short is available on a Disney DVD called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;tag=tikiroomcom&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=tg/detail/-/B000ATQYUG">Disney Rarities</a>. Check out <a href="http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-character-ranger-j-audubon.html">2719 Hyperion&#8217;s overview</a> of this great oft-forgotten Disney character.<br />
UPDATE:  I need to remember to search Youtube before making any post. In The Bag is on Youtube right now. I&#8217;m not sure how long it will be on there, but for now, enjoy!<br />

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I lived in Seattle, each trip to Disneyland was preceded by an evening spent getting into town and checking in at the hotel. Disneyland had to wait until the morning, but that wasy okay&#8230; it was thrilling just to be <i>near</i> Disneyland, even the warm night air was otherworldly to me. Everyone has their own Disneyland routines &#038; rituals, and mine started that night before, in a far corner of the Disneyland Hotel. That&#8217;s where, twice a night, they ran the Fantasy Waters show:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XUR5YQ7RALQ"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XUR5YQ7RALQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />
Disneyland Hotel&#8217;s Fantasy Waters show, from ru42</div>
<p>It was the perfect thing to feed my building excitement for the next day. It&#8217;s gone now. I&#8217;m sad it&#8217;s not there anymore, but now that I live in California my Disneyland rituals have changed, and I probably wouldn&#8217;t make it over to see it very often anyhow. I have about a hundred photos of the show, which is pretty silly &#8212; the show isn&#8217;t much to look at in static form. Hanford found this for me the other day, and I was thrilled to get to watch the show again. This is the &#8220;new&#8221; version that was rolled out in the &#8217;90s, so it&#8217;s a little sad, but it&#8217;s still the Fantasy Waters show. Keep your ears perked for a rare bit of Captain EO. [uploaded by <a href=http://youtube.com/watch?v=XUR5YQ7RALQ>ru42</a>]</p>

<p>The <a href="http://davelandblog.blogspot.com/">Daveland</a> blog has some great pictures from the Goody Clancy architecture firm of the house as it was being constructed. I love the above picture of the completed home &#8212; largely because it captures the pastoral feel of the landscaping, which is in such sharp contrast to the modern-as-modern-can-be home. I also love this picture to the left &#8212; this time, it&#8217;s the contrast of the traditional Sleeping Beauty&#8217;s castle in the background against the upstart little plastic building.</p>

<p>The wonderful Disney Blog <a href="http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2007/03/man-in-space-march-9-1955.html">2719 Hyperion</a> has a great piece on the <i>Man In Space</i> episode of Walt Disney&#8217;s Wonderful World Of Color, (the episode turned 52 just a few days ago). The episode is a peek into what the 1950s envisioned the future of space travel to be like. It features both live action lectures by Disney animator Ward Kimball and rocket scientist Wernher von Braun, as well as some animated futurist visuals that are not to be missed. 2719 Hyperion does a better job than I do at really coveying the impact of this midcentury science film:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the most interesting footnote about Man in Space is the largely unnoticed impact it had on the development of the U.S. space program. President Eisenhower was so impressed with the program, he requested a print of the film to screen for high-ranking Pentagon officials, which was evidently instrumental in kick starting the country’s space initiatives.</p></blockquote>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saint Patrick&#8217;s Day is coming up &#8212; that means it&#8217;s nearly time for one of my very favorite movies: Darby O&#8217;Gill and the Little People. Darby O&#8217;Gill is a live-action Disney film from 1959. It doesn&#8217;t get as much attention as I think it should.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/darby-ogill-fiddles-a-tune-for.jpg" alt="Darby O'Gill fiddles a tune for the Leprechauns" title="Darby O'Gill fiddles a tune for the Leprechauns" height=375 width=500 /><br />

<p>Reasons you should watch the Darby O&#8217;Gill and the Little People DVD:</p>
<p><span id="more-16"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>It has a pre-James Bond Sean Connery, in his first major film role.</li>
<li>Sean Connery <i>sings</i>.</li>
<li>Albert Sharpe as Darby O&#8217;Gill is the most inspired bit of casting, ever.</li>
<li>The special effects are astounding &#8212; especially considering they didn&#8217;t have computers or blue screens to work with.</li>
<li>Drinking, and whiskey, are openly celebrated &#8212; the high point is a drinking song with Darby O&#8217;Gill and the King of the Leprechauns.</li>
<li>There are only a handful of extras on the DVD, but they&#8217;re excellent:
<ul>
<li>A documentary on how they did the special effects, which is mind-blowing, in both its ingenuity and its simplicity</li>
<li>&#8220;I Captured the King of the Leprechauns&#8221; &#8212; a whole black &#038; white episode of the Disneyland TV show, with Walt Disney himself going to Ireland on the advice of his actor friend Pat O&#8217;Brien, where he meets Darby O&#8217;Gill, and talks the King of the Leprechauns into being in his movie.</li>
</ul>
<li>It&#8217;s just a damned fine little movie.</li>
</li>
</ul>
