		<description><![CDATA[Quote: Okay, how is it that every single commenter so far (’cept for me) has been male? I’m not complaining or anything. It’s just… unexpected

Well for one, you said this was just for the ladies, which to me meant, girl secrets and tickle fights.

You used the word &#039;Squeamish&#039; which meant something cool was going to happen, and thirdly, you warned us not to read it.

This is probably why there is a warning on your hair dryer as to NOT use it in the shower...Sometimes men will do exactly the opposite of what they are warned NOT to do.

The word &quot;menstrual&quot; was almost the deal breaker, but you re focused our short attention span with the word &quot;Cooter&quot;.

After that I kinda blacked out, and woke up writing this response.

I have to say, this article really unlocks the mystery of what goes on behind those bathroom doors.

Somehow I always figured it was as simple as a Moist Towelette, a quick reload, so to speak, and &#039;Boom&#039; off to your spin class you go...

But now all I can picture, is it being more like gutting a greased pig while wearing oven mitts.

My life is changed now.  I will never be able to reclaim the innocence I had just a short 15 minutes ago, as I was laughing at you in the bacon costume.

I have to go now...the fire department is here to help remove my foot from the toaster (again)...

But I will leave you with this...you women are a mystery that men should NEVER try to solve, even IF it is  possible...]]></description>

VanTiki -- that&#039;s too funny. I&#039;ll be sure to give Hanford some advance warning so he doesn&#039;t get his hopes up at seeing me slaving over the stove.

		<description><![CDATA[Man, this one killed me!  My wife went through all the stages of shock, denial, suspicion, and eventual acceptance (and love) that you describe.  The only think you didn&#039;t mention is the horror of finding the cup bobbing about in a briskly boiling pot on the stove.  &quot;ooo - whats for dinn - OH GOD!&quot; :)]]></description>
