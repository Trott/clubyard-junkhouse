		<description><![CDATA[Oooh, you&#039;ve built your own? Fantastic! How long did it take you to put together?

Definitely not pictures of nozzles, only nighttime photos of the show in action. Unfortunately, they&#039;re primitive paper photos, and they&#039;re packed into a box right now. The next time I come across them, I&#039;ll see if I can find some that are worth the time to scan them, and I&#039;ll let you know!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It really was the poor man&#039;s Fantasmic. The updated show would have been far better served if they had used music from Stay Awake rather than from Simply Mad About the Mouse. Yma Sumac&#039;s &quot;I Wonder.&quot; Way cooler than Ric Ocasek&#039;s &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.&quot;]]></description>
