        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently discovered a few cool things. </p>
<p>1. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.hardrockpark.com/">Hard Rock theme park</a>. </p>
<p>2. In said theme park is a section called <a href="http://www.hardrockpark.com/bornintheusa/bananasplitsville.cfm">Banana Splitsville</a>. </p>
<p>Sadly there&#8217;s not much info or photos of it on the web yet, but apparently the <a href="http://www.mbsun.com/index.cfm/2008/8/15/The-Banana-Splits-are-Back-Warner-Bros-Serves-Up-Four-Scoops-of-Hilarity-with-Relaunch">Splits themselves perform there several times a day</a>. Can anyone help me out? </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splitsvile.jpg" alt="Banana Splitsvile" title="Banana Splitsvile" align="center"/></div>
<p>3.  The <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/05/02/ben-jerrys-steals-the-banana-splits-logo/">Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s Banana Split ice cream </a>changed their logo to something that does not infringe on the Splits. Hopefully photos will be coming soon. (thanks Humu for the tip!). </p>
<p>And perhaps a little less cool:  </p>
<p>4. The Banana Splits have updated their <a href="http://www.bananasplits.com/">website</a>, and recorded new videos and songs, which are on sale on iTunes, if you&#8217;re so inclined!. Sadly, they sound nothing like their old selves. </p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/mad-super-special-mystery-record.jpg" alt="Mad Super Special Mystery Record" title="Mad Super Special Mystery Record" align="center"/></div>
<p>Before I traded in my National Geographics for <strike>Playboys</strike> Hustlers, I was a consistent reader of MAD.  What I really loved was the occasional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexi-disc">flexi-disc</a> records they&#8217;d include in their Super Specials. And the holy grail of all flexi-discs was The MAD Mystery Record. The record played &#8220;Super Spectacular Day&#8221;, a story in song that described the most absolute best day you could ever be having &#8212; <i>until</i> &#8212; the record randomly branched into one of eight different disastrous random endings. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s still clever even as an adult, but as a kid I was simply fascinated by it. How could a record have different endings? How did the record choose which one to play? I played the record over and over to hear them all and to study how it worked. Finally my Dad explained it to me: while normal records have one spiral groove per side, the MAD disc had multiple grooves spiraled together in parallel. All of the grooves had music that started off with the same beginning, so the branching appeared to happen mid-way through. But in reality it was the initial drop of the needle that determined what ending played. </p>
<p>Super Spectacular Day is a classic example of MAD&#8217;s corny humor. And of course, someone has put all eight tracks on Youtube so you can enjoy it for free (Cheap!). The actual playback of the song starts about 30 seconds in. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the Lyrics, courtesy of <a href="http://barrygoldberg.net/sillysongs/superspectacular.htm#all">barrygoldberg.net</a>, rearranged to match the order of the Youtube video:  </p>
<p>CHORUS:<br />
It&#8217;s a great big, beautiful, wonderful, incredible, super-spectacular day<br />
And your heart is humming with good times coming<br />
And you got that happy feeling things are going your way<br />
All the bells are ringing and a little bird&#8217;s singing while he sits on your windowsill<br />
Singing yessiree, I can surely see, it will plainly be, most definitely<br />
A super-spectacular day! </p>
<h3>Untilllllllll&#8230;</h3>
<p>#1<br />
&#8216;Round quarter to five your relations arrive<br />
And you greet cousin Beth with terrible breath<br />
And a fat British guy who destroys your hi-fi<br />
And your great uncle Fred who gets drunk in your bed<br />
And your third cousin Dick who is metally sick<br />
And his creepy friend Joe and six more you don&#8217;t know<br />
And you&#8217;re sure there and then as you&#8217;re shafted again&#8230;</p>
<p>#2:<br />
&#8216;Round seven at night you go out for a bite<br />
The streets are aglow from a large UFO<br />
A creature comes out with two heads and a snout<br />
It talks like a frog and throws up on your dog<br />
It thinks you are great and wants you for its mate<br />
You&#8217;re sealed in a case and go flying in space<br />
And you silently say as the Earth fades away&#8230;</p>
<p>#3:<br />
You walk out the door of a dry cleaning store<br />
And you&#8217;re grabbed by surprise by three mafia guys<br />
Who mistakenly think that you&#8217;re Hymie the Fink<br />
They break your right arm and do bodily harm<br />
And you&#8217;re writhing in pain and you try to explain<br />
That your name is Jerome and you&#8217;re on your way home<br />
And you let out a sigh as you&#8217;re left there to die&#8230;</p>
<p>#4:<br />
A quarter past eight you pick up your blind date<br />
And you really go ape for her fabulous shape<br />
Of the girls that you&#8217;ve met she&#8217;s the classiest yet<br />
And she&#8217;s pretty and bright and it&#8217;s love at first sight<br />
And it&#8217;s really a shame she&#8217;s not feeling the same<br />
&#8216;Cuz she thinks you&#8217;re a shmuck and she says &#8220;lots of luck&#8221;<br />
And you sob in despair as she gives you the air&#8230;</p>
<p>#5:<br />
You&#8217;re called down in class and you feel like an ass<br />
&#8216;Cuz you don&#8217;t have a clue and you know that it&#8217;s due<br />
To those classes you skipped and you&#8217;re fly is unzipped<br />
And your acne has spread to the back of your head<br />
And some jerk spreads the word that you&#8217;re some kind of nerd<br />
And you fight in the hall and punch through a wall<br />
And there isn&#8217;t a doubt as they&#8217;re flunking you out&#8230;</p>
<p>#6:<br />
You develop a twitch and a horrible itch<br />
And you&#8217;re covered with spots and you&#8217;re getting the trots<br />
And you&#8217;re feet start to swell and it&#8217;s easy to tell<br />
From this hideous wheeze that some awful disease<br />
So you call an M.D. and he says &#8220;don&#8217;t ask me&#8221;<br />
If it gets any worse you can speak to my nurse<br />
And you manage to say as you wither away&#8230;</p>
<p>#7:<br />
Your sister pours glue in her hair and blames you<br />
And your neighbor says that you&#8217;re abusing her cat<br />
And you just left the john with the water turned on<br />
And the house gets all wet and your mother&#8217;s upset<br />
And you&#8217;d die if you knew what your dad&#8217;s gonna do<br />
And your python gets loose and you know it&#8217;s no use<br />
And you cry there in fear and it&#8217;s now very clear&#8230;</p>
<p>#8:<br />
You go out for a spin and your sunroof caves in<br />
And the steering wheel shakes so you slam on the brakes<br />
And the gears get all stuck as you sideswipe a truck<br />
And you run out of gas while you&#8217;re trying to pass<br />
And you&#8217;re stalled on the tracks and you try to relax<br />
But the train&#8217;s coming through and it&#8217;s heading for you<br />
And you have a quick flash as you brace for the crash&#8230;.</p>
<h3>&#8230; that it’s not such a super-spectacular day!</h3>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/audium-001.jpg" alt="Audium " title="Audium "/></div>
<p>I was having dinner with a friend of mine two weeks ago, and she asked me what kind of music I listen to. In reality I listen to a lot of stuff &#8212; too diverse to lump into a single category &#8212; but for a few years now I&#8217;ve jokingly used the term <b>Electro-Acoustic  Soundscapes of the 70s</b>. (My friend Martin coined that phrase after unsuccessfully searching through my iPod for 80s music). She had no clue what kind of music I was talking about and she pressed on, so I half-seriously elaborated with &#8220;You know, electronic boops and beeps, like outer-space stuff&#8221; even though I mostly <i>don&#8217;t</i> listen to that; it&#8217;s just a small sliver of my collection. And then the conversation moved on. </p>
<p>Little did I know that the 30 seconds I spent rattling off that term would pay me back so heartily. The next week she invited me out to a bar in San Francisco and warned me not to be late.  After a quick drink, we walked down the street a few blocks until we came to an old looking wood-paneled building.</p>
<p>Opening the door revealed a museum-esque interior with a ticket booth, stationed by a very distinguished looking older woman.  We purchased two tickets at $15 each, and we&#8217;re handed two programs labeled <b>Audium: A Theatre In Sound-Sculptured Space.</b> At this point my friend tells me that she remembered me talking about electronic beeps and whooshes from the previous week, found out about this place just by blind luck, and took me here sight-unseen because she thought it might &#8220;have some of that kind of beeping stuff in it&#8221;. Little did she know how right she was. </p>
<p>We stepped into a <i>very</i> serious looking room filled with sound-related sculptures as well as an array of speakers playing ambient noise: gentle water gurgling, hummingbirds zipping from one side of the room to the other. But this was just the lobby. Clearly this place was built in the 70s, and it looked like not much had changed. And after a bit of waiting around, the ambient noises got louder and the lights in the lobby grew dim, at the same time a spotlight appeared on a wood-paneled hexagonal door, where an gray-haired gentleman appeared.  </p>
<p>He informed us and the other two dozen-or-so people in the lobby that we were about to enter the Audium, where we would be treated to a 139 speaker audio-performance-in-the-round dealing with &#8220;space and time travel&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it was going to be completely in the dark. For an hour. </p>
<p>And then we went inside. The theater itself looks as if the designers were going for <b>2001: A Space Odyssey</b> but instead ended up with a set from <b>Dr. Who</b>. It was exactly what I was hoping for. The theater is arranged in a circle, with speakers all over the place &#8230; hanging from the ceiling, built into the walls, and under grates on the floor. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.audium.org/audium_1.jpg">
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/audium.jpg" alt="Audium" title="Audium"/></div>
<p></a></p>
<p>The real kicker, however, was when the lights dimmed out to complete blackness and the experience started. The soundtrack was straight out of the 1970s and didn&#8217;t sound like it had ever been updated (although I found out later that it had). But this was not music. Electronic beeps and boops were everywhere, &#8220;flying&#8221; through air, along with droning Wagnerian-style synth power chords, abruptly shifting to lo-fi organic recordings of nature, before popping back to beeps. Despite the 139 speakers in use, most of it sounded like it was just coming out of the four big speakers in each corner. It was largely rhythmless, and had no apparent story arc or narrative that was discernible from just listening.  And the fidelity matched the decor. This was cliche 70s sci-fi art-school-project-on-drugs sound effects with a dash of the Space Mountain queue soundtrack thrown in. And it just kept going and going.  </p>
<p>Half way through the performance there was a 5 minute (lighted) intermission and half the audience left, never to return. At this point I turned to my friend and asked her if she had it in her to listen to the second half, because she had no clue going into this what she was in for, isn&#8217;t into electronic music, and even I was kinda worn out by it. But she was gung-ho for soldiering through the second half &#8230; which ended up feeling like it was twice as long as the first half. </p>
<p>After the show was over, I was in shock. An hour in the dark listening to 1970s sound effects will do that to you. A zillion questions raced through my mind. Why have I never heard of this place? How did my friend find it? How has it not changed since the 70s? Why were they still getting crowds? I desperately wanted to talk to the gray haired guy, who turns out is the founder and sound designer, but I was worried he was going to chew my already-tired ear off with space and time travel theories. </p>
<p>The entire night was a completely surreal experience. If you&#8217;re into the mid century space-age movement at all, you need to go check the Audium out before it closes or gets remodeled. Even though I didn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; what the soundtrack was about, and I thought it was a little long to sit through, I absolutely loved it and now I want to take all my friends. It&#8217;s definitely worth doing once for the sheer novelty effect even if you&#8217;re not into electronic music. But you better go soon &#8230; it really feels like it could close its doors for good any second.  </p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.audium.org/index.html">Audium</a>&#8216;s website.</p>
<p>Audium 8 is performed every Friday and Saturday at 8:30pm. Price $15<br />
Arrive by 8 pm since part of the fun is the lobby.<br />
<em>Please double-check before showing up, I really get the feeling this can change at any time. </em></p>
<p>1616 Bush St. (@ Franklin), San Francisco<br />
Information: (415) 771-1616</p>
<p>*For the record, the 1970s electronic music I prefer is actual music, with percussion, melody, and harmony. The Audium had none of that.  And yes, I did apologize to my friend for fibbing a little about my musical tastes. </p>

&#8220;We Are Apple,&#8221; uploaded by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJy0O4UFSM">adiblasi</a></div>
<p>So, I broke down and bought an iPhone (about 20 minutes after the price drop was announced) &#8212; my first purchase of an Apple product. I didn&#8217;t even have an iPod, that&#8217;s how out if it I&#8217;ve been. Of course, now I&#8217;ve drunk the Apple Kool-Aid, and I think this phone is the greatest thing since, I dunno, the Newton. It&#8217;s fab (especially now that we&#8217;ll get some legit third-party apps soon). But this video is fabber.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/make-it-happen.jpg" alt="Make it Happen" title="Make it Happen" height=249 width=300 /><br />
Make it Happen</div>
<p>This has been kicking around in low-quality form for awhile, but this version was uploaded to YouTube by someone who was at the video&#8217;s original mid-&#8217;80s presentation, and he had a high-quality copy. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hen I saw this &#8216;live&#8217; at the Mac introduction, we, as Apple Dealers, all LAUGHED OUR ASSES OFF at time marker 02:47 &#8211; when the guy carried a 60 pound LISA computer under his arm like it was a laptop!</p></blockquote>
<p>What I really want to know is &#8212; where did this wooden sign wind up? I hope it&#8217;s still up in someone&#8217;s cube in Cupertino.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope the music was at least half as good as the cover art &#8212; way groovy:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/65426141"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/the-quests-go-go-requests.jpg" alt="The Quests' Go Go Requests" title="The Quests' Go Go Requests" height=509 width=500 /></a><br />
The Quests&#8217; Go Go ReQuests</div>
<p>A post on <a href="http://robotactionboy.wordpress.com/2007/05/02/1330/">Robot Action Boy</a> pointed me to this <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/the_record_collection&#038;page=all">treasure trove of Asian pop album covers from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s</a>. Good god, they just keep going and going&#8230; and every last one has got some kind of crazy-cool thing about it. </p>
<p>The Quests&#8217; <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/65426141"><i>Go Go ReQuests</i></a> album (pictured above) &#8212; well, you can see for yourself how fabulous it is. One of the songs on the album is &#8220;Ding Dong Twist,&#8221; which sounds like either a new Hostess snack product, or an obscene gesture. <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/68851593"><i>Sing Along With the Christones</i></a> features a band of young, hip, Asian priests &#8212; each wearing one of those little white &#038; black priest collar things. <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/70589462"><i>Four Hits</i></a>, also from the Quests, has a very soulful-looking pointing finger on the cover &#8212; appropriately, to illustrate their song &#8220;Soul Finger.&#8221; Now, that&#8217;s a song I want to hear.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/74455206"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/off-beat-cha-cha.jpg" alt="Off Beat Cha Cha" title="Off Beat Cha Cha" height=199 width=200 /></a><br />
Off Beat Cha Cha</div>
<p>Some of the albums look funky, like they may be soundtracks to obscure Thaispoitation films&#8230; others look like the Ravi Shankar&#8217;s schtick re-arrived back home after being filtered through the Beatles&#8230; and lots are clearly light, fluffy Go-Go dancing frothiness, complete with smiling, happy girls. Well, except for <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/74455206"><i>Off Beat Cha Cha</i></a>, which has three girls who are clearly dancing under court order and are miserable about it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it, go check out the <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/the_record_collection&#038;page=all">entire gallery of albums</a> for yourself at David Greenfield&#8217;s photo site.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here at Junkyard Clubhouse we love all things junkyard, and right at the top of our list are Junkyard bands.</p>

<p>And Fat Albert has one of the rockin&#8217;est Junkyard bands ever.  The groovy kids record blog <a href="http://wayoutjunk.blogspot.com/index.html">Way Out Junk</a> has gifted the Internet with not one, but TWO rips of classic Fat Albert and the Junk Yard Band albums: <a href="http://wayoutjunk.blogspot.com/2007/04/creativity-starring-fat-albert-and.html">Creativity</a> and <a href="http://wayoutjunk.blogspot.com/2006/08/rock-n-roll-disco-with-fat-albert-and.html">Rock N&#8217; Roll Disco</a>. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://wayoutjunk.blogspot.com/2007/04/creativity-starring-fat-albert-and.html"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/fat-albert-and-the-cosby-kids.jpg" width=320 height=315 alt="Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids" title="Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"/></a><br />The famous junk yard band is organized when the kids are unable to afford musical instruments</div>
<p>Listening to these records will convince you that real-life junkyard instruments can sound <i>just like</i> the smooth sounds of studio musicians! Actually, while the <i>pictures</i> of the Junkyard band are pretty sweet, there&#8217;s not much in the way of classic Fat Albert music on either of these albums. The Rock N&#8217; Roll Disco in particular is pretty bad.  Hmmm. Now I&#8217;m wondering why I even bothered bringing it up. Here, watch the opening of the Fat Albert Show instead.</p>

Meshugga Beach Party at Forbidden Island Tiki Lounge</div>
<p><a href="http://www.meshuggabeachparty.com">Meshugga Beach Party</a> played at Forbidden Island Tiki Lounge&#8217;s first anniversary party this weekend (which was a <i>blast</i>, by the way&#8230; <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/fianniversary/">here are my pics</a>). I hadn&#8217;t heard of them before, but quite a few folks in the crowd had. From my photo above, you probably have them pretty well figured out &#8212; they perform traditional Jewish folks songs as surf tunes. And they perform in full Hasidic regalia (those beards must get awfully itchy). But the best part: they&#8217;re really good. I&#8217;m not a surf music aficianado, but I run in a pretty surf-savvy circle, and there was high praise for Meshugga Beach Party all around.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know!</p>
<p>In 2002, the band <a href="http://www.chocodog.com/chocodog/ween/ween_new/noflash_fr.html">Ween</a> was approached to write a jingle for one of Pizza Hut&#8217;s Desperate Product Reconfigurations of the Month, the Insider pizza. The Insider pizza was the one where they put a layer of cheese inside the pizza&#8217;s crust. Never has a new pizza design so captured the imagination of the nation, with the possible exception of the P&#8217;zone.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut wanted to hire an edgy band come up with an edgy jingle for their very edgy new product, hence Ween. Ween came up with a funk-infused ditty, &#8220;Where&#8217;d the Cheese Go?&#8221; Click play to hear it:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/audio/cheese.mp3">Download audio file (cheese.mp3)</a><br /><br />
Where&#8217;d the Cheese Go?</div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/N1zL13LvxS8"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/N1zL13LvxS8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />
&#8220;Where&#8217;d the Cheese Go?&#8221; video, by <a href="http://www.oblongpictures.com/cheese.htm">Oblong Pictures</a>
</div>
<p>Pizza Hut didn&#8217;t like it, or any of the other attempts that Ween made at giving them what they wanted. They wrote, they re-wrote, and finally, tired of it all, they wrote &#8220;Where&#8217;d the Motherfuckin&#8217; Cheese Go At?&#8221; </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/audio/cheese2.mp3">Download audio file (cheese2.mp3)</a><br /><br />
Where&#8217;d the Mutherfuckin&#8217; Cheese Go At?</div>
<p>In case the title doesn&#8217;t make it obvious, that one&#8217;s NSFW, unless you&#8217;ve got headphones handy. And thus, Ween&#8217;s association with Pizza Hut ended before it even really started, probably to the delight of all.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.mrbalihai.com/goof/2007/04/paranoid_autobahn.html">Mr. Bali Hai</a> to blame for this one:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jh9wrMfw7QA"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jh9wrMfw7QA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object><br />
1971, Cindy und Bert sing &#8220;Der Hund von Baskerville&#8221;</div>
<p>German singing sensation duo <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_%26_Bert">Cindy und Bert</a> sing a song about the Shelock Holmes story &#8220;The Hound of the Baskervilles,&#8221; in German, to the tune of Black Sabbath&#8217;s &#8220;Paranoid.&#8221; German youth dance, morosely. An utterly un-houndlike dog yawns. Cindy und Bert sing with all the fiery passion that might go into ordering a bowl of potato soup. The camera tries, valiantly but unsuccesfully, to perk the scene up with some violent zooms in and out of the &#8220;Hits-a-Go-Go&#8221; logo.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never heard of Cindy und Bert, but apparently they were all the rage in Germany and the Netherlands in the &#8217;70s. Just so you don&#8217;t think they were all doom &#038; gloom, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_v6m34cJHE">much perkier Cindy und Bert</a>, in 1973.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/the-wombles.jpg"  alt="The Wombles" title="The Wombles"/></div>
<p>When I was very, very young (but I can&#8217;t remember how young) &#8230; I had some vague memories of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_splits">Banana Splits</a> that were <i>not quite right</i>. All my Banana Splits memories were from when I was pretty young, but I seemed to have memories of the Splits looking different than they normally do. All this time I had chocked it up to fuzzy, incorrect memories due to my little kid brain. But just a few years ago I came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombles">The Wombles</a> on the Internet, and then <i>it all made sense</i>. I recognized the characters faces and the hats immediately. Those early memories weren&#8217;t of the Banana Splits, they were of the Wombles.  Who knew the market for fuzzy characters in costumes singing Bubblegum was so big? </p>
<p>I have no idea how I saw it as a kid, since it seems like it was shown primarily across the pond.  Does anyone out there remember seeing The Wombles? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a great feeling to put to rest fuzzy mysterious memories that have been lingering in my head for decades. </p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because the POWER of <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/11/luie-luie-will-pierce-your-innermost-with-his-pearly-trumpet/">Luie Luie&#8217;s liner notes</a> is just too overwhelming to the average unsuspecting Junkyard Clubhouse frequenter &#8230; we have DISTILLED its power into digestable, bite-sized quotes of WISDOM that will change DAILY. And change <i>you</i> daily.</p>
<p>Yes, every day at midnight the Luie-matic 5000 will pick a random sentence from off the back cover of the &#8220;Creator of TOUCHY&#8221; album and serve it up in a little box on the left-hand sidebar on JYC.  Included with the quote is the paragraph and sentence number where the quote appears, if you&#8217;d like to see it in context. Not that you&#8217;d need to, because just about every sentence is, in and of itself, unfiltered magical brilliance.</p>
<p>We hope that by displaying a random quote daily, you&#8217;ll be seduced slowly by these affirmative truisms that remind you that the Power of Touch and the Power of Music is indeed powerful power. If you think you can handle it check out the <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/11/luie-luie-will-pierce-your-innermost-with-his-pearly-trumpet/">entire transcription</a>. You&#8217;ll be glad you did. Otherwise, check our sidebar for this little daily gift. </p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Ze King! Ze Premier! Then all the ministers!<br />
Army! Navy! Department Sanitaire! &#8230;</em></p>
<p>This Harveytoon cartoon isn&#8217;t really outstanding in any particular way, but it&#8217;s one I remembered as a kid I&#8217;ve wanted to see again for probably the last 20 years.  I&#8217;ve searched for it several times before, and while it&#8217;s mentioned in several places in the web, I&#8217;ve only come across an actual video of it very recently!  It&#8217;s beloved by many, but probably totally unknown to most. Here&#8217;s the description from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151276/">IMDB&#8217;s entry</a> for it, see if it shakes loose any memories:</p>
<blockquote><p>A French shopkeeper&#8217;s life is disrupted by a daily parade. The parade consists of &#8220;ze king, ze premier, all ze lords and ministers, army, navy, department sanitaire.&#8221; When the &#8220;department sanitaire&#8221; hits a pothole, all the garbage gets dumped onto the street in front of his store.</p></blockquote>

Luie Luie, Creator of &quot;TOUCHY&quot;</div>
<p>One of my more prized possessions is this LP. Meet Luie Luie. Luie Luie recorded this album in 1971 &#8212; he composed, arranged and played all the music on this album. Luie Luie, you see, is a dynamo. </p>
<p>He hoped to spur a new dance craze, called the Touchy. As Luie Luie explains in one of several opening monologues, Touchy songs all start with a &#8220;<i>wiiiiiild trumpet introduction</i>,&#8221; signalling that it is time to start dancing the Touchy. To dance the Touchy, you dance however you want, as long as you are touching your partner. Any body part will do: nose-to-nose, elbow-to-elbow, toe-to-bellybutton, &#8220;<i>or what have you</i>.&#8221; </p>
<p>I was hepped to Luie Luie thanks to Hanford and his copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B00006NSX1%26tag=hukoti-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B00006NSX1%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Songs in the Key of Z</a>, which has the first song from this album, &#8220;El Touchy&#8221;:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/audio/eltouchy.mp3">Download audio file (eltouchy.mp3)</a><br /><br />
Click play to hear El Touchy, and be forever changed</div>
<p>Once I heard it, I knew I had to track down this album. It wasn&#8217;t easy, but it was well worth it &#8212; surprisingly, not just for the songs, but for the astounding text on the back of the album. Just when I thought the writing had reached the apex of absurdity, <b>bang!</b> &#8212; it got weirder. And weirder. The internet&#8217;s many Chuck Norris biographers could learn a thing or two from the back of this album. When I die, I want my eulogy to simply be someone reading the back of this album, replacing &#8220;Luie Luie&#8221; with &#8220;Humuhumu.&#8221; </p>
<p>Luie Luie is never one to disappoint his audience, and to celebrate his inimitable spirit, I offer for you here, today, in its entirety, the actual liner notes from this album, formatted as close to the original as I could muster. Enjoy.</p>
<p><span id="more-28"></span></p>
<hr style="padding-bottom:30px;"></hr>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">LUIE LUIE plays his intimate music beyond the keyboards; past the drums, outside the Trumpet. His galaxy of instruments cannot contain him.

You will thankfully draw a deep breath and relax comfortably wherever you are.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">LUIE LUIE&#8217;s valued friend and Mystic Master, Hamid Bey, from Egypt, donated a fountain of Faith and strongly foretold his fabulous success. &#8220;TOUCH OF THE PHAROAHS&#8221; is presented in this album to his honor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">On Land or Sea and in the Air, LUIE LUIE has got to be the only one of his kind in the world.</span></p>
<table align=center style="margin:15px;font-family:Arial;">

Undisturbed by any other musician, LUIE LUIE, although ethereally trained and self taught, serves you his pure music, flying thru countless numbers with the agile ability to switch instantaneously to a distinguished mundane manner.</span><br />
<span style="font-family:Arial;">Brilliant! . . . . A Genius in his unique, unequalled interpretations. Organ, Piano, Guitar, Drums, Trumpet . . . He plays them all. Put any of 24 instruments within his long reach and he&#8217;ll play it. Name your number LUIE LUIE will leap at it like a tiger&#8211;and leave you breathless. . . . . He&#8217;s an actor and a comedian whose vocal improvisations will cajole and tantalize you.</span><br />

<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">In addition to Music, LUIE LUIE also excels in MARTIAL ARTS. He is an authority and originator of &#8220;MANAZO&#8221; fighting. What is faster than greased lightning? &#8220;MANAZO&#8221;, an open handed combat method of blinding speed. LUIE LUIE claims he can flip the light switch and jump into bed before the light goes out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">He created the &#8220;MANAZO MONKS&#8221;, a communion of powerful men and enchanting music delightfully graced in flawless motion, cadenced to split second timing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">LUIE LUIE is also an accomplished Artist in Murals . . . Paintings in oils up to 30 feet long. His canvasses will thrill the most discreet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">Multilingual, LUIE LUIE is madly devoted to the devout from the main springs of humanity. Here is a man to be reckoned with . . . a King in his playground.

An incredible performance while enraptured agnostics wait hopefully for an explosion. AND THEY GET IT!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;">LUIE LUIE will astound you with his boundless energies and will play six hours straight thru, without stopping for the dinner bell. This to the utter amazement and awe of audiences all over town. He has set capacity records in every showplace he has visited.</span></p>
