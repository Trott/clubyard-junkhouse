        <p>I&#8217;m so excited about this, I might not be able to sleep tonight:</p>

1980s Sea Galley television commercial</div>
<p>When I was a tyke growing up in Seattle, Sea Galley was the height of fine dining, as far as I was concerned. On our birthdays, my brother Bob &#038; I got to choose any restaurant in the entire city for our special birthday dinner. The answer was <i>always</i> Sea Galley, much to my parents&#8217; chagrin. </p>
<p>In my eight-year-old eyes, Sea Galley was <i>fancy.</i> It had enclosed booths, and nets, and nautical bric-a-brac everywhere. It was dark, and mysterious, and it felt like you were being led through a maze when you were led to your table. And there was a <i>salad bar.</i> It was the first place in town to have a salad bar (as far as I knew), and it felt extravagant. The salad bar had baby corn. Baby corn! We&#8217;d never seen baby corn before, it was so dainty and adult. And they let you have all the baby corn you wanted! It didn&#8217;t even count as part of your meal! What a magical place!</p>
<p>The kids&#8217; menu was shaped like something &#8212; I don&#8217;t remember what exactly, probably a diver&#8217;s helmet &#8212; and it included a list of non-alcoholic tropical beverages with crusty, sea-dog sounding names. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, Sea Galley is at least 70% responsible for my love of tiki bars, even though it was nautical, and completely tikiless. Since my love of tiki bars is a fairly massive part of my life, I still have a lot of reverence for Sea Galley.</p>
<p>There are two places I&#8217;ve been in my adulthood that look a bit like Sea Galley, and they&#8217;re both in Los Angeles (it&#8217;s no coincidence that I adore L.A.): <a href="http://www.critiki.com/cgi-bin/location.cgi?loc_id=145">Bahooka</a> in Rosemead, and <a href="http://www.thewarehousemdr.com/">the Warehouse</a> in Marina del Rey. But I see them with adult eyes, and while I love them, the mystique is not quite there. There is only one restaurant that still gives me the same sense of childlike awe: <a href="http://www.critiki.com/cgi-bin/location.cgi?loc_id=60">the Mai-Kai</a> in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I&#8217;ve searched high &#038; low to find my adult Sea Galley, and the Mai-Kai is it, no doubt.</p>
<p>Right about when I was in the fourth or fifth grade, Sea Galley started a new advertising campaign, advertising their crab legs.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="../../../../images/dancing-crab-chefs-at-sea-galley.jpg" alt="Dancing crab chefs at Sea Galley, from Sanderson Studios" title="Dancing crab chefs at Sea Galley, from Sanderson Studios" height=300 width=391 /><br />
Dancing crab chefs at Sea Galley, from <a href="http://www.sanderson-studios.com/cli-seagalley.html">Sanderson Studios</a></div>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got crab legs!<br />
Sea Galley!<br />
We&#8217;ve got crab legs!<br />
Sea Galley!<br />
We&#8217;ve got snow-snow-snow,<br />
king-king-king,<br />
Dungeness, too!</p>
<p>Get your crab legs!<br />
Sea Galley!<br />
Get your crab legs!<br />
Sea Galley!<br />
We&#8217;ve got crab legs!<br />
So come get&#8230; your&#8230; crab leeeeeeeegs&#8230; TONIGHT!
</p></blockquote>
<p>This compelling bit of lyrical artistry was sung by a trio of half-chef, half-crustacean people, who literally had crab legs. And they danced. And they REALLY wanted you to eat their crab legs. I remember it being a pretty big deal &#8212; they did a whole series of commercials, and I remember all of us kids lining up Rockette-style in the schoolyard and singing &#8220;we&#8217;ve got crab legs!&#8221; complete with high kicks. I think there is an entire generation of Seattle children who cannot see crab legs without singing the song, at least under their breath. I know I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>By the end of the &#8217;80s, Red Lobster rolled into town, and ruined everything. By that time, I had finally moved on from Sea Galley, so I don&#8217;t know what kind of shape the restaurants were in towards the end. It&#8217;s probably best that I never saw what became of my beloved Sea Galley.</p>
<p>Hanford has heard all about the glories of Sea Galley, and has heard me sing &#8220;We&#8217;ve got crab legs!&#8221; enough times that he now sings it unprovoked himself. Can you imagine my joy at actually <i>finding</i> <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zQSNnGFJ4Ro">the commercial</a> on YouTube today? Probably not. Unfortunately, the quality isn&#8217;t very good, but you can still sort of make out some of the nets &#038; other nautical decor. <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=zQSNnGFJ4Ro">Bebeya</a>, thanks for making my day.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>ah..i remember those commercials, but i don&#8217;t recall if i ever went there. in fact until this post i think i may have had them confused with red lobster(shame, i know). for us as kids, the be-all-in-all of restaurants was farrell&#8217;s. part excitment, and part fear of being embarrassed to death. and of course when you lined up to leave you wandered through that aisle of tempting candy(and man, those jaw breakers lasted forever!). this all makes me wonder, whatever happened to pizza pipes? is it still there?</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Pizza &#038; Pipes is long gone, I&#8217;m afraid &#8212; I think the spot is now a Blockbuster Video? I just loved Pizza &#038; Pipes. Every time we went, I asked the organist to play Clementine. I liked the song okay, but really it was just the only song I could think of. I loved those bubbles that went everywhere; I saw enough of the Lawrence Welk show to think that it was just a standard part of any musical performance, but I still thought they were neat.</p>
<p>A friend of mine who grew up in Phoenix told me about a pizza &#038; pipes place there that&#8217;s still operating called <a href=http://www.organstoppizza.com/ rel="nofollow">Organ Stop</a> &#8212; it sounds like it&#8217;s a lot more elaborate than the Pizza &#038; Pipes in Seattle. I&#8217;ve heard there&#8217;s a pizza &#038; pipes place here in the Bay Area, too, but I don&#8217;t know the particulars.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>pizza and pipes is still there!  it is on the corner of a strip mall in santa clara.  it is at the intersection of lawrence expressway and homestead road.  i grew up in that place, we went EVERY week.  the one caveat, though, is that around the time &#8220;we built this city&#8221; by starship came out, they remodeled the place to have a race car theme.  we started not going so much after that.  however, the place still retains the same name, and im really curious to see what its like.  </p>
<p>you guys should go check it out!  it is in the same complex as contantino&#8217;s grocery store, and across from where bullwinkle&#8217;s used to be (now it is some lame dance club called avion or something).</p>

The website does have an interesting page about Pizza &#038; Pipes restaurants, though, and it turns out the Seattle restaurant was the same chain as the Santa Clara spot, and Santa Clara was the original location. Neat!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Where the frothy brine and octopedal minions of the oceans dark and murky depths meet white linens and wall mounted harpoons, that is where you&#8217;ll find Sea Galley&#8230; Or maybe it was just somewhere on north Aurora.<br />
I was always very intrigued by the bar section off to the right as you entered the restaurant. I also remember it how you do, Michelle, like you were being led into a labyrinth. I think that was probably the greatest part of it. The subdued lighting and all the crap mounted on the walIs.<br />
I remember I had sore legs once while we were eating and dad said &#8220;Thoses are just growing pains&#8221; The implication probably being that it was my birthday, and I was growing up, which of course can only lead to pain, withering and death. &#8220;But until then, kid, you&#8217;ve got tonight; and tonight, you&#8217;ve got CRAB LEGS!&#8221;  F#*k YEAH!!!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Sea Galley had a great business, service and marketing model. Good food, great family environment and just plain enjoyable. Truly an all around treat. And, a good bargain. And, a fun place to go for everybody. Every lunch and dinner, every day the place was packed, even during Seattle&#8217;s slow economy.</p>
<p>Then . . . the management went crazy, or got greedy, or something and decided to go &#8220;yuppie&#8221; (an 80&#8242;s term) by totally changing their decor, making it more &#8220;elegant&#8221;; changing the menu to include haute cuisine and postage stamp portions; took away the salad bar; made it too stuffy to bring kids; hiked the prices way up.</p>
<p>The first time we went into one of the remodeled units (Totem Lake) was the last time we walked-in the door. Within weeks of making these changes you could go into a Sea Galley on a Friday evening and shoot a cannon through the place without hitting anyone.</p>
<p>To my experience, no one has come close to duplicating Sea Galley. Unfortunate indeed!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Hello,<br />
There is a SeaGalley in Yakima Wa. The only one left other than Anchorage. It is all original with the nets and booths.<br />
It still has the salad bar and runs the Crab Legs commercial on the local radio and sometims of the T.V. If you are ever<br />
in Eastern Washington its right off the freeway. They have the BEST appetizers especially the Cheese Sticks. The original<br />
crab legs are sometimes worn to the Basketball games in Yakima to hand out coupons. Look up their webpage at seagally.com !!!!</p>

I started with them in Yakima so I know the store pretty well.  Your right on the changes, that ruined the whole deal, it all started with the stripped uniforms and went downhill from there!  I was just at the Yakima one a year ago and it is still as good as ever.</p>

where I worked, and while I don&#8217;t remember the food being all that spectacular, it was a<br />
great place for happy hour. I&#8217;ve lived in PA for the past 19 years, and it sure made me<br />
feel nostalgic to watch the old Sea Galley ads on YouTube, along with the KST-Washington<br />

Ivar&#8217;s still around?)</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>All the Skipper&#8217;s are pretty much gone (the last one I remember going to was in 2007 in Auburn and I told myself that would be the last time, it was).  The quality really went downhill pretty drastically.  Ivar&#8217;s is still around (The Captains Table on Elliott has been gone for awhile), still good, a little pricey.  Many of the Keg restaurants in the area (they replaced Sea Galley) are gone or are closing now.  Excluding the Crab Legs, the closest thing left around here to Sea Galley (even though it has a different theme) is Barnaby&#8217;s at Southcenter.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I am really surprised at how much everybody on here seems to have loved the crab legs commercials, because for me, every time one of these came on TV, I RAN and hid behind the couch and covered my eyes and plugged my ears until it was over! I was completely TERRIFIED by the crab legged chefs! They gave me incredible nightmares.</p>
<p>Growing up in Kennewick, Washington, our Sea Galley was right down the street from our house (literally two blocks away). A year after these commercials came out, and after a pep talk from my dad, we had dinner there one night. After we got there, my dad mentioned to the waiter that I was massively afraid of their commercials, and the waiter, thinking he was being playful, said to me &#8220;Oh, not to worry &#8211; the crab leg chefs are in the kitchen, cooking &#8211; they won&#8217;t come out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran out the door, sprinting the two blocks back to the house, vowing never to go back.</p>
<p>Funny thing is, years later, my first job was as a bus boy at the same Sea Galley! John Sanchez was the Manager there, and he was great. I still remember him asking me during my interview: &#8220;Are you a mover and a shaker? &#8216;Cause that&#8217;s what I need &#8211; a mover and a shaker.&#8221; I learned the value of work in that place &#8211; lessons still resonating today.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Of course I remember the song!  I was 12 in 1980, and I think anytime you had a group of boys together, running around, that song was bound to come up and singing ensued.<br />
I also remember when they built the Sea Galley in Puyallup.  For Puyallup, and for that time, it was a BIG deal.  My sister in law went to a huge audition for a cocktail waitress position.  I remember she got the job and for a week I would grill her on every item on the menu.  The restaurant opened, the wait times were long, but it was the place to be in that little town.  The last time I was there, the building was still standing but the Sea Galley had been closed for years.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I was tortured by those Sea Galley adds.  I did not live close to a Sea Galley but only got to see the commercials.  I wanted nothing more than to go to that magical place with dancing chef/crab men.  I actually ate at a Sea Galley for the first time ever while traveling.  It was exciting for me, and sad to hear the waitress tell me that Sea Galley is a dying breed.  I described the commercials to my 14 year old son, and as I did so, I realized the concept of it sounded ridiculous.  But, from a child perspective it was the best ever.  I did order the crab legs when I ate there last month.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Grew up in Bellevue with a Sea Galley beside a Uwagimaya.   My dad went on business trips frequently, many to Alaska in fact, and while he was gone it became a tradition for me and my mom to go tot he Sea Galley and eat together.  I really liked the place, but we moved to Portland in 1986.  Interestingly enough, one of the co-owners of Sea Galley started a second franchise called &#8220;Flakey Jakes&#8221;, right about 1983 or 1984.  It was a burger place, the first &#8220;burger bar&#8221; ever.  You could get 1/3 lb hot dogs and 1/2 lb burgers cooked to your liking, fries, and huge milk shakes.  They had the best video games too and the atmosphere, unlike Sea Galley, was more like being apart of a country ho-down in a barn.  We loved both places.    Sadly, Flakey Jakes over franchised, just as Sea Galley did and suffered from the intrusion of a competitor named Fuddruckers, much like Sea Galley suffered from Red Lobster.  We did find one last remaining Flakey Jakes in Danville, CA circa 1990 or so, but even that place closed.  I&#8217;m glad to see Sea Galley is still alive in Yakima and Anchorage, I smell a road trip for piracy on the crab leg seas!</p>
