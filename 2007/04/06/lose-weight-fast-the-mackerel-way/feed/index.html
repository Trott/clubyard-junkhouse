		<description><![CDATA[Looking at this gave me a flashback to going through my mother&#039;s kitchen cabinets. My mother never gets rid of anything, so even though i grew up in the 80&#039;s, my parent&#039;s house probably looked just like it did in 1974. She has tons of these, and old cookbooks going back to the 50s. I just gave her a call to tip her off on trying to sell off some of these on ebay. Surely someone collects vintage cookbooks.]]></description>
