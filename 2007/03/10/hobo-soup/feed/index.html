&quot;This soup was the brainchild of a small-town newspaperman from Ortonville, Minn., who in 1953 went into the local hobo camps in search of a feature story. As a result he was treated to old-fashioned homemade hobo soup and felt the world should share in this down-to-earth cuisine. Made with beans, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, celery, onions, and turnips, and flavored with bacon to give it a satisfying smoky taste, this thick and hearty vegetable soup is literally a meal in itself. Simply heat and eat.&quot;]]></description>
