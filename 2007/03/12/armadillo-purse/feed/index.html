		<description><![CDATA[I am selling an armadillo purse for my aunt like the little rolled up critter above.  It was purchased for her by my uncle while he was on a business trip out west in the 60&#039;s.  It was never used and still has the tag which says &quot;Bolsa legitima concha de armadillo  Hecho en Mexico&quot;.  Anyone interested, please make an offer pboggs43@yahoo.com.]]></description>

Seriously. If you love animals, don&#039;t purchase these handbags. Armadillos are not just found dead and turned into cute purses. They are murdered for profit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[How can you people not be ashamed by what you&#039;re saying ? That is a poor animal. Do you actually believe that the people who sell those bags wait for those poor animals to die in an accident ? How can you be so cruel and wear an actual being as a PURSE ?!
I&#039;m sorry but I honestly can&#039;t imagine a normal person wearing an animal for a purse, it just seems sick to me]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My husband purchased a armadillo purse years ago, at a yard sale. It has just been sitting on a shelf. It&#039;s in excellent condition. It&#039;s football shaped, has green beaded eyes, a oval clasp, gold with red color. There is a compact mirror inside the lid, still intact. The purse has a long braided handle attached to the purse. If anyone is interested in buying this, please leave a message at e-mail address. Would like to see it go to someone who would really like to have it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have this same purse that I purchased when I was 17 in Tijuana, Mexico at a purse store.  My best friend and I talked the guy down in price. He wanted $30 each and we both bought one so he gave it to us for $25 each.  I am now 42 so this price was quite some time ago! The inside of mine is also maroon and it has bright green bead eyes. Mine looks exactly like the picture. We thought they were Cool! I still just love mine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so happy! My sister found this exact armadillo purse in a thrift store in Portland, OR, and picked it up for me for $25.00 -- expensive for a thrift shop.

I just love it; it&#039;s lined with a maroon felt-type material and in perfect condition. Good idea about adding brass feet to it; I&#039;ll do that. I just hope I won&#039;t get hassled &quot;wearing&quot; it in San Francisco!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have 2 full armadillo purses.  The tail comes up and over the back and connects behind the head to make a handle, the inside is hollowed out and lined and the top of the back opens up with a circular zipper and there is a mirror there. They have jewels in the eye sockets.  One was my mom&#039;s and she used it in the 60&#039;s - 70&#039;s and one was my aunt&#039;s.  They are pretty cool and have been sitting atop a bookshelf in my house as decorations.  They are banned now, and I don&#039;t believe it is legal to import them from Mexico any more. I recently had cancer and lost my home, will be homeless Oct. 1st and so am getting rid of everything I have, unfortunately, these purses need to go. I can send photos and will ship them...I can also accept payment through paypal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My mom had an armadillo purse that I admired for so long because it was so different.  I was in my 20&#039;s then.  I am now 44.  My mom also had an antique store in Inglewood CA,now she uses the internet for her sales.  I asked her about 2 yrs ago what happened to that bag and she told me she sold it.  I was shocked. i would love to have that bag!!]]></description>
