Boomerang</div>
<p>Just when you think that the Internet holds all the answers, it fails you. My search for information about Boomerang, a &#8217;70s kids&#8217; TV show from my native Seattle, has turned up nearly bupkes.</p>
<p>I did learn something very interesting&#8230; I had no idea that Marni, the host of Boomerang, was none other than <a href="http://adf.ly/CGdsR ">Marni Nixon</a>. </p>
<p>Nixon is the reason Julie Andrews won her Oscar for Mary Poppins. Well, that&#8217;s not fair &#8212; that was a well-earned Oscar. (Those who already know this story can skip ahead a couple of paragraphs.) Julie Andrews had starred on Broadway in the hit musical My Fair Lady, and won a Tony award. But when My Fair Lady was turned into a Hollywood film, Julie Andrews was not yet a name movie-goers would recognize, and Warner Brothers cast Audrey Hepburn in what really should have been Julie Andrews&#8217; role. Walt Disney knew better, and cast Andrews that same year in Mary Poppins. Mary Poppins, and Julie Andrews, became a smash sensation. </p>
<p>When the press started to dig a bit, and learned that Audrey Hepburn didn&#8217;t actually sing her parts &#8212; that the beautiful voice behind &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t It Be Loverly&#8221; and &#8220;I Could Have Danced All Night&#8221; was actually Marni Nixon&#8230; well, Jack Warner started to look like a fool for having ditched Julie Andrews. In Julie Andrews&#8217; Oscar acceptance speech for Mary Poppins, she thanked &#8220;the man who made this all possible&#8230; Jack Warner,&#8221; which makes me love Julie Andrews even more. </p>
<p>Marni actually has a brief role in Mary Poppins, as one of the animated geese, but didn&#8217;t meet Andrews while working on that film. When Nixon and Andrews later worked together on The Sound of Music (Nixon played one of the nuns), Andrews introduced herself with a hearty handshake, and exclaimed &#8220;I really love your work!,&#8221; probably with a cheeky look in her eye. Marni also was the singing voice for Maria in West Side Story, and she did some vocal work for a Mr. Magoo album, &#8220;Magoo in Hi-Fi&#8221; and provided &#8220;ethereal voice effects&#8221; for some Esquivel albums. She was a very, very successful session singer in Hollywood.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still having trouble reconciling the host of Boomerang with this Hollywood figure, but it comes together a bit when I hear the Boomerang theme song again &#8212; the song&#8217;s not exactly a winner, but it sure brings back memories, and that voice is loverly:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="../../../../wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf" width="290" height="24" id="audioplayer1"><param name="movie" value="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf" /><param name="FlashVars" value="playerID=1&amp;bg=0xfaf4db&amp;leftbg=0xfcd770&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xf5c02c&amp;rightbghover=0xfcd770&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0xf7ed68&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.junkyardclubhouse.com%2Faudio%2Fboomerang.mp3" /><param name="quality" value="high" /><param name="menu" value="false" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /></object><br />
Click play to hear the Boomerang theme song</div>
<p>This still leaves plenty of holes about Boomerang the show, though. I can fill in a little bit more from my own memories: It aired on channel 4, KOMO, which was Seattle&#8217;s ABC affiliate. It was filmed during the late &#8217;70s into the early &#8217;80s, and continued on in reruns for a while. Marni&#8217;s co-star was a yellow puppet boy, who looked like a cross between Bert from Sesame Street and Terrence from South Park. <strike>I can&#8217;t remember his name, and I couldn&#8217;t find it online.</strike> His name was Norbert. (Thanks melberoo!) There&#8217;s one episode in particular that I remember, where Marni was hired to do a commercial for some silver polish, but she tries the polish and it doesn&#8217;t work very well, and she decides to not do the commercial. It was a lesson about not whoring oneself out, and whenever I&#8217;m faced with similar scenarios, I always think of Marni&#8217;s frustration with the silver polish. Overall, the show was on the schmaltzy side, and if we&#8217;d had the variety of cable back then, I probably would never have watched it.</p>
<p>So anywhere, there you go. That&#8217;s all I could find about the Seattle show Boomerang. Maybe someday something more will show up.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>i remember boomerang! i don&#8217;t think i even really realized it was local. i do remember that my parents took us all to some classical music night(at least that&#8217;s how it felt as a child) at some theater in seattle and marnie was the performer singing. the only part of the show i really remember is that for an encore(at least i think it was an encore) she introduced some piece and said it was supposed to be a duet, but she&#8217;d do it anyway. well, when it came time for the other singer&#8217;s part the conductor turned around and started singing.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Oh, I&#8217;m so glad I&#8217;m not alone! I imagine this whole post is snoozeville to most of the JYC readers, but I&#8217;d hoped it&#8217;d mean something to Seattleites.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was local myself. As I got older, I figured it must have been, since it wasn&#8217;t something that ever got referred to in popular culture. </p>
<p>I was also looking for info on Hot Fudge (specifically, the opening theme song), which I thought was local, but I was wrong. It was produced in Detroit. We didn&#8217;t like Hot Fudge &#8212; it was on super early on Saturday mornings, and if we turned on the TV and it was on, we knew we&#8217;d miscalculated, and woken up too early. I don&#8217;t remember it very well, but I remember the theme song <i>juuuuust</i> enough for it to bug me, and I hope that hearing it again will let it rest. I remember it being funky and weird. Anyway, I couldn&#8217;t find the Hot Fudge theme song.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>NORBERT! Oh, thank you. I kept thinking it was Bert, but I thought that couldn&#8217;t possibly be, because he looks too much like Bert from Sesame Street to get away with that. Norbert. Ahhh.

<p>Cat Kaz, that&#8217;s too cool! If I ever track down the opening, I&#8217;ll be sure to let you know. You might try contacting KOMO, too &#8212; since you&#8217;re actually in the opening, it might spark their interest in helping you find the old footage.</p>

<p>A TV star fallen on hard times</p>
<p>West Seattle resident Gina Terrana could scarcely believe her eyes at the West Seattle garage sale last week. Could it be? Oh, surely not. But then she paid the price — $2 — and took home the bright yellow puppet with the shock of red fur hair. </p>
<p>What a bargain. </p>
<p>Turns out the puppet is Norbert, star of &#8220;Boomerang,&#8221; a KOMO-TV kids&#8217; series that aired in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s. Norbert — although stripped of his trademark rugby shirt — looks like a second cousin to Ernie of &#8220;Sesame Street&#8221; fame. </p>
<p>During its heyday, &#8220;Boomerang&#8221; won some dozen Emmys for Norbert and his buddies, among them puppeteers Lee Olson and Kathy Tolan; writer Nancy Schwedop; performer Marni Nixon; director Ken Schwedop, and producer Barbara Groce. </p>
<p>Terrana says, &#8220;Norbert is staying at my house right now. But if the Museum of History &amp; Industry wants him, let me know. He deserves a secure retirement.&#8221;</p>

as a child it MUST have been local because of that farm! I also remember someone falling in<br />
the haypile and getting hay thrown in the face playfully and another child making airplane<br />
wings with his arms,loved the beginning of the show! I&#8217;ve been around the world in the<br />
military &amp; as a civilian and always had that song with me-and I&#8217;m a rocker! Boomerang and<br />

and found nothing until now. Thank you for that opening song! It brought back memories.<br />
I had no idea it was a local show. I, too, loved the opening and wish I could<br />
see it once again. I also watched Dusty&#8217;s Treehouse, Banana Splits, and Star Blazers,<br />
among some others. I saw J.P. Patches live at some Elks Club event my Grandpa took me to.<br />
I was picked to go on stage and he made me kiss some boy!! I thought that was so &#8220;yucky&#8221;<br />
being so young. Anyway, what neat information I have learned tonight and I think I&#8217;ll<br />

      <div class="commenttext"><p>This was a pleasant find today.  I was reading a book with my child that talked about a boomerang which instantly made me recall one of my favorite shows as a kid.  I was prompted to do an internet search and found this site.  I&#8217;ve had the same experience as some folks here with my husband who thought I was making this stuff up.  The infectious song brings me right back to childhood.  I&#8217;m totally bummed that I can&#8217;t find a clip of it on youtube.com or elsewhere.  At least I got to listen to the song again!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Wow, hearing that theme song brings back memories.  I grew up in British Columbia and watched Boomerang regularly.  Now living in Quebec, nobody here has ever heard of the antics of Norbert or Melinda, nor do they know what &#8216;bing, bong, bang&#8217; means.  It is so refreshing to read the entries of others who grew up with Norbert, Marni and company.  If anyone ever finds a clip from the show, please please please post it&#8230;I&#8217;d love to see the gang in action.  This show and ol&#8217; JP were very fond memories from my young childhood&#8230;.thanks for setting up the site.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I just discovered this website.  Have been looking for Boomerang info to show my grandkids and son-in-law.  My daughter was one of the little &#8220;Boomerang kids&#8221; in the opening (she&#8217;s the tiny little African American girl in a red dress).  She is skipping along and then there is a shot where she is being carried!  She was around 4 or 5 years old (I think); it was a very, very long hot day spent on that farm with take after take and she got very tired, so some one picked her up:)  I worked at KOMO for years and it was great to see the idea become an multi-Emmy award program.  The entire cast and crew were remarkable and in those days we were all truly a team.  Your interest and memories stirred up my own experience with the show and now I&#8217;m on a real hunt to find some episodes!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

So the other day the Boomerang theme song popped into my head for no reason&#8230; so then it was off to the internet to find out about this show that I vaguely remember from my childhood in Tacoma.  Thanks for the research.  I guess I&#8217;ll check back here every so often.  I really wanted to find video clips but that .mp3 REALLY brought back the memories for me.</p>

I don&#8217;t even know how old I was when I watched this show &#8211; but I am 35 now &#8211; so I imagine I was pretty young.  </p>
<p>I too am interested in finding a video- I was singing this song and my 14 year old son wondered what i was singing &#8211; so I decided to show him a video on youtube and coudn&#8217;t find it.  So off to google I went.  I am so glad I found this site.  Hearing that song created a wonderful trip down memory lane.</p>
<p>I remember the boy flying like he was a plane, the kids holding the letters, the beach ball that Marni threw against the wall and how it bounced back.  I sing this song in my head and sometimes out loud&#8230; I think it is comforting to me.  </p>
<p>If someone finds a video &#8211; or wants to flood Komo with a bunch of emails for some footage &#8211; I would be on board.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>WOW!!! My twin sister and I grew up with Boomerang as well, and like so many who have posted here, would LOVE to see it again.  There aren&#8217;t too many episodes that I can remember fully, but I DO remember the one posted above of Marni being hired for the polish commercial and then backing out because it didn&#8217;t work.  I remember Melinda as being a brat and the little negro puppet, Libby, and obviously Norbert!!  I just clicked on the song and am proud/embarrassed to say that I remember the whole thing word for word, as well as the visuals of it starting with the big letters being held up, the kid falling into the hay and the other kids brushing more on top of him, and marni leading the kids as they follow her with their arms spread wide like boomerangs.  Thank you so much for helping to bring back these memories.  If only they would release the show on DVD, or at least youtube. There&#8217;s probably so much more I would be amazed and thrilled to remember as I saw complete episodes again.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I am Anna&#8217;s twin from the above post. I don&#8217;t remember as much as she does about the show. I remember the opening theme like I saw it yesterday. However, I don&#8217;t recall any memories of what any of the episodes were about. Odd. I remember Norbert with his orange hair but I thought Libby was a caucasion girl with brown hair and I don&#8217;t remember Melinda at all. I would LOVE to see the opening theme again. Listening to it is great but seeing it would be even better. A trip down my childhood memory lane for sure. </p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I grew up in Seattle, born in &#8217;79, and I too watched this show. I didn&#8217;t, and still don&#8217;t, remember anything but the theme song and opening/end titles, but those bring back warm memories. I Googled it a few years ago and found zip, a year and a half ago I found a few blurbs mentioning Marni Nixon and noting that it was a local show only. Humuhumu, I never saw Hot Fudge as a kid, but evidently there were two versions of the show &#8211; the early one with Arty (Artie?) and a later version with Seymour being the focus. But an entire episode of the early version, in parts, is on YouTube, complete with its awesome trippy, psychedelic cut sequences. Thanks again for posting the theme music, and for making me smile and feel all warm and fuzzy.</p>

I too had trouble finding ANYTHING on the web except for this site (lol, I had to google &#8220;boomerang norbert&#8221; to get here).</p>

I have to say I thought that it *was* Julie Andrews who hosted it.  But I was like 4 when it was on so what did I know.  Also, it aired in Canada.  At least the part of Canada that is directly north of Seattle.  Cuz that&#8217;s where I am from.   But I have only ever found one other person who has even heard of it.  Somewhere someone has tapes in their basement and the episodes will finally surface.</p>

The one kid really did think he was Rodney Allen Rippy during that shoot!</p>
<p>My neighbor was the producer there (Barbra Groce) and she needed kids one days for this thing she was doing.  We went to a float farm in Auburn to shoot the into.  Did it in one day.  Had lots of fun, had many interactions with Marni (and her daughter was the tall redhead in the front of the line).  As my mother liked to say, &#8220;I sent her out of the house with Shirley Temple curls and she came home with her shirt tied up around he waist, straight hair and sweat tracks down the dust on her arms.&#8221;  I have one episode on tape, but will have to figure out a way to get it converted to digital!  </p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I&#8217;m astonished that I found this site, because I&#8217;ve wondered about this show for years!  What a treat to see the video of the title sequence.  Hearing the recorder flute in the beginning of the song opened up a vault of memories that had been closed-off for decades.  And I have to admit, it made me well-up with emotion when I listened and watch the video.  I have vivid memories of watching that show as a child, making a point not to miss it.  </p>
<p>When my dad was at work, and my sister at school, I remember being home with my mom, and watching Norbert, Melinda and Marni.  I too had a bit of a crush on Marni.  Maybe I thought she was cute or something, or maybe it was her singing ability.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful if we could get access to the episodes.  Why would KOMO appose releasing them?</p>
<p>Again, seeing this seriously brought tears to my eyes, and made me long to be a child again.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for posting information about this great show.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Wow&#8230; I watched this as a kid in Vancouver, BC in the 70&#8242;s and I have always wondered about it.  I loved the show and my only memories were of the Boomerang song at the begining.  I also remembered that I marveled at the freedom the kids had running around the barn and the grassy areas.  I grew up as a latch key kid in downtown Vancouver so I was very envious.</p>
<p>Now that I have my own kids, I&#8217;d love for them to see the shows I grew up with.  I also remember the Polka Dot Door.  Thank goodness I can find some clips on Youtube on that show.  If only someone could post clips from Boomerang there too&#8230;</p>

He then informed me that they still had them (displayed) in the family room. Seeing those puppets again brought back a lot of childhood memories. Now I&#8217;m here, posting.</p>

My older sister seems to think I make up most of my childhood memories because she does not remember the same things or as much as myself.  However, I know I am not crazy making things up thanks to all of you cool people out there in the Northwest who remember &#8220;Boomerang&#8221; as well.  I love how some of the children that were in the opening credits have commented on here too.  I really enjoyed reading everyone&#8217;s memories.  The other show that I watched too that no one seems to remember but me was &#8220;Jeremy the Bear&#8221;.</p>

And then watching the VHS recording of the opening was sooo sweet.  Thank you for that.  I wish there were more episodes.  I&#8217;m going to call and email KOMO and see what they can do.

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Ok, so I am trying to explain my old Voltron toy to my 4 year old. From there we look at old cartoons on youtube, Voltron, Gummy Bears, New Zoo Review, and &#8230;..Boomerang. Nothing about Boomerang, so I do a search and come across this web site. I had never known that Boomerang was broadcast in Seattle, but wait, it is all coming together. Does anyone remember going with their parents to Nordstrom (a company started in Seattle)and buying shoes. They used to give you a balloon called Norbert, which resembled the character on Boomerang. Is there any connection? just a thought. Kind of interesting trivia since there is so little about Boomerang on the internet, but there is a video of every episode for other oldies but goodies.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Thank you Christy from Orting. You mentioned Star Blazers. I loved that show. But I was begining to think I made it up. No one else in my family remembered it. Now I don&#8217;t think I am losing my mind. Also, just watched the opening of Boomerang on youtube. I almost cried. I started singing along with it. Now I can&#8217;t get it out of my head. OH well. Worse things could be stuck up there. Thanks again to all who recall this show. Someone should make a facebook page for Boomerang fans like us.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I remember searching for Boomerang online a few years ago and reading something about KOMO cleaning out their vaults and throwing all of the Boomerang episodes and puppets into the dumpster. I just looked again to see if I could find the article/blog that I read, but no luck. If anyone has any copies of this or any inclination to bug KOMO and see what can be done about the licensing involved with getting dvds made of this show, it might be high time to get busy on that! I would be utterly crushed to see such an important piece of local history vanish forever.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>The blue boy&#8217;s name was Rookie, a late addition to the roster. I assume they added him because Norbert needed a male friend. Rookie was big and looked kind of intimidating, so it was easy for a casual watcher to mistake him for Crusher. As for Crusher, he was an unseen character &#8211; a school bully who terrorized Norbert, or at least made his life uncomfortable.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Well, I&#8217;ll hazard a post amongst the spam. Thank you for the memories.</p>
<p>Here is an episode description from the historic Seattle Times.</p>
<p>1975/12/7. Wed 10:30am, Boomerang: Norbert and Libby are stuck indoors on a rainy day and have to put their imaginations to work. Marni sings &#8220;Supercalifragilistic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, the first episode was given rave reviews by the paper, on the subject of friendship. Marni sang &#8220;Getting to know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norbert was first, and Libby joined after three months for the Christmas special. Two new holiday songs were written, &#8220;Nicer in December&#8221; and &#8220;Something is Happening&#8221;. Bush School students appeared as carolers.</p>
<p>Boomerang won three Emmy awards 1976 for puppeteer Lee Olson, host Marni Nixon and writer Nancy Schwedop. Over its run it pulled in 26 total, 4 for Nixon.</p>
<p>Only 3000 of the Boomerang 45s were made, and about 300 of them were mislabeled.</p>
<p>In 1977 the show expanded to twice a week and won an award from Action for Children&#8217;s TV for &#8220;its use of story and song to ease the process of growing up.&#8221; </p>
<p>In 1979 Lee Olson left for Los Angeles.</p>
