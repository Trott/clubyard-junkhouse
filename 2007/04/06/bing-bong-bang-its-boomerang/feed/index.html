		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;ll hazard a post amongst the spam. Thank you for the memories.

Here is an episode description from the historic Seattle Times.

1975/12/7. Wed 10:30am, Boomerang: Norbert and Libby are stuck indoors on a rainy day and have to put their imaginations to work. Marni sings &quot;Supercalifragilistic.&quot;

Also, the first episode was given rave reviews by the paper, on the subject of friendship. Marni sang &quot;Getting to know you.&quot;

Norbert was first, and Libby joined after three months for the Christmas special. Two new holiday songs were written, &quot;Nicer in December&quot; and &quot;Something is Happening&quot;. Bush School students appeared as carolers.

Boomerang won three Emmy awards 1976 for puppeteer Lee Olson, host Marni Nixon and writer Nancy Schwedop. Over its run it pulled in 26 total, 4 for Nixon.

Only 3000 of the Boomerang 45s were made, and about 300 of them were mislabeled.

In 1977 the show expanded to twice a week and won an award from Action for Children&#039;s TV for &quot;its use of story and song to ease the process of growing up.&quot; 

In 1979 Lee Olson left for Los Angeles.

		<description><![CDATA[The blue boy&#039;s name was Rookie, a late addition to the roster. I assume they added him because Norbert needed a male friend. Rookie was big and looked kind of intimidating, so it was easy for a casual watcher to mistake him for Crusher. As for Crusher, he was an unseen character - a school bully who terrorized Norbert, or at least made his life uncomfortable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember searching for Boomerang online a few years ago and reading something about KOMO cleaning out their vaults and throwing all of the Boomerang episodes and puppets into the dumpster. I just looked again to see if I could find the article/blog that I read, but no luck. If anyone has any copies of this or any inclination to bug KOMO and see what can be done about the licensing involved with getting dvds made of this show, it might be high time to get busy on that! I would be utterly crushed to see such an important piece of local history vanish forever.]]></description>

Yeah, we saw Boomerang on KOMO as well, though across the border.

I seem to recall some real life kids, though I may be confusing it with something else.]]></description>

A Boomerang, a boomerang

You throw a ball against a wall
and what does it do?
It comes back to you!
Like a boomerang, boomerang!
Boom, bong, bang, that&#039;s boomerang!

We all have seen a trampoline, 
where you bounce so high
and then down you fly
like a boomerang, boomerang
Bing, bong, bang it&#039;s boomerang!

It&#039;s a funny looking thing
Something like an airplane wing
And when you throw it ever so high
So high it seems to hide in the sky
It fools you with it&#039;s specialness
while turning around and falling back!

A boomerang, a boomerang.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Christy from Orting. You mentioned Star Blazers. I loved that show. But I was begining to think I made it up. No one else in my family remembered it. Now I don&#039;t think I am losing my mind. Also, just watched the opening of Boomerang on youtube. I almost cried. I started singing along with it. Now I can&#039;t get it out of my head. OH well. Worse things could be stuck up there. Thanks again to all who recall this show. Someone should make a facebook page for Boomerang fans like us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember being very little and watching what must have been re-runs of this show. I&#039;m 23 now, and the only thing I can really remember of this show was the theme song... and possibly some kids carrying around some gigantic letters.

This song totally brings me back, though. I, like so many others here, was looking everywhere for this show. I guess this is the hub where all of us must go. I don&#039;t think there is any sign of Boomerang anywhere else online.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok, so I am trying to explain my old Voltron toy to my 4 year old. From there we look at old cartoons on youtube, Voltron, Gummy Bears, New Zoo Review, and .....Boomerang. Nothing about Boomerang, so I do a search and come across this web site. I had never known that Boomerang was broadcast in Seattle, but wait, it is all coming together. Does anyone remember going with their parents to Nordstrom (a company started in Seattle)and buying shoes. They used to give you a balloon called Norbert, which resembled the character on Boomerang. Is there any connection? just a thought. Kind of interesting trivia since there is so little about Boomerang on the internet, but there is a video of every episode for other oldies but goodies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just looked this up after watching the sound of music.  I knew Marni was one of the nuns.  I loved boomerang,  and thank you soo much for the song.  I almost was 5 years old again!  Norbert and Libby was the other puppets name.  I also seem to remember a bird that came down from somewhere with a message.  I may be wrong it has been a while.  Thanks again!]]></description>
