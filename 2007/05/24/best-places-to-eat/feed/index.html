		<description><![CDATA[Nice pics I must say.. especially the one with the guy tossing pizza. Great catch!

Toyoda Sushi looks like a friendly and homely place to be. I love places where the owner gives nice and friendly service :)

THanks for the great description and picture to the places you recommend. I love the effort and your recommendations :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@JN: there&#039;s got to be better food up in the city -- there&#039;s just got to. But yeah, your neck of the woods is probably a lot like my neck of the woods, in terms of culinary options.

@william: It&#039;s entirely possible! I worked there in the winter of &#039;90/&#039;91. I woulda looked like &lt;a href=&quot;http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&amp;friendID=981702&amp;albumID=0&amp;imageID=4762390&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, but that was ages ago, there wouldn&#039;t be any reason to remember me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooh, wow.  This might take me a minute because this:

&quot;how can a region that hosts a world-class university (Stanford) and the headquarters of some of the brightest, youngest, hippest companies around (Google, Yahoo!, Apple, and about a hundred more) feel like such a cultural wasteland?&quot;

is what I&#039;ve been thinking for the almost 6 months I&#039;ve lived here.  San Francisco!  Silicon Valley!  THERE IS NO GOOD FOOD.  Granted, I can&#039;t have gluten anymore, but even before diagnosis I was having trouble - especially with finding good ethnic food.

I&#039;m going to start a draft, but it might take a few days because I&#039;m having the same problem.  I might have to bring Ann Arbor into the mix.  God, I miss the great restaurants and the amazing cultural diversity in Ann Arbor.  Sigh.]]></description>
