		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to say, the cratered economy has caused Taschen to put several projects on the back burner while the company concentrates on its core titles. They&#039;ve never done a car design book and a bum economy has made them skittish. The book is done, it&#039;s even been translated into four languages. I&#039;ve been paid in full. But still, Cartopia languishes in limbo. I will be giving a talk ion this subject Feb. 20, 2012 as part of Palm Springs Modernism Week.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Hu,

Just ran across this again. Amazing, but I did just actually sign a contract with Taschen for Cartopia. . . one year to the day from this post. 
Book should be in the shops about a year from now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, talk about your serendipitious moments!

Jim mentioned his Cartopia project to me back in 2005, so he&#039;s been shopping this around for quite a while now. Hope the deal goes through.]]></description>
