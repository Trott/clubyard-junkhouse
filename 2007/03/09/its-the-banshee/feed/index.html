It stars the same two kids from Mary Poppins (the film even bills them as &quot;The Mary Poppins Kids&quot;!), and it seems to be trying to be Darby O&#039;Gill, but it&#039;s really terrible. It came out in 1967. It&#039;s just awful, but I&#039;ve got a soft spot for terrible old Disney films almost as much as I&#039;ve got a soft spot for the really good ones.]]></description>

certainly was a hoot. Have to pick up a copy this month.]]></description>
