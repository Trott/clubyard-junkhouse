Couldn&#039;t she (or Invicta) have made a similar dress, straightened her hair, removed her make up and shown us a little more hip movement?  And where is the red chair? I feel cheated!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No lie, April 8 eve, I was in Georgetown (a Seattle neighborhood) on my way to a bar, and saw a faded Mastermind Deluxe edition (which I had never seen before) in the window of a record store. I looked at for a minute or two, and was reminded of when I used to play Mastermind a bunch with a boyhood friend back in the late 1970s, and remember feeling the James Bond/spy vibe from it. Then I saw this post which was a bit bizarre, and tonight after dinner with a couple of friends the talk of playing a game popped up, and what should appear on the table, Mastermind. I proceeded to play for the first time in more than a couple of decades, and actually figured out the first one in six tries, failed completely on the second round, while my partner blew my mind with five tries the first round, and frickin&#039; four tries the second time. Beautiful randomness.]]></description>
