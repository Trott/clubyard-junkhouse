		<description><![CDATA[Favorite quotes:

Twas brillig, and slithy 30s Ribosome did gyre and gimble...

Bound they were in the glorius sun by initiator factor 1!

Initiator factor 2 went searching for tRNA, who bore the flacid amino acid.

(sung by a hippie) whoooaaa whoa hoo hoo! HYDROGEN BOND!!!

I only have two criticisms for this movie. First, I don&#039;t ever remember hearing about amino acids wearing clothes, so these people should have been naked. Second, everything they are showing occurs on the molecular level. Molecules are small. They should have been using midgets. Naked midgets.

In closing I would like to say that the producers were truly onto a &quot;happening&quot; when they introduced the &quot;dance idiom&quot; I have to wonder about how our lives would be improved if our politicians were forced to use the descriptive and exhuberant language of dance when introducing their ideas to the population of our great nation. This, I believe, would also have the effect of bringing a youthful freshness to our capital, since fillibustering would call for an all night freak out. Thank You.]]></description>
