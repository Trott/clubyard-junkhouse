            <div class="entry">
                <p>I recently discovered a few cool things. </p>
<p>1. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.hardrockpark.com/">Hard Rock theme park</a>. </p>
<p>2. In said theme park is a section called <a href="http://www.hardrockpark.com/bornintheusa/bananasplitsville.cfm">Banana Splitsville</a>. </p>
<p>Sadly there&#8217;s not much info or photos of it on the web yet, but apparently the <a href="http://www.mbsun.com/index.cfm/2008/8/15/The-Banana-Splits-are-Back-Warner-Bros-Serves-Up-Four-Scoops-of-Hilarity-with-Relaunch">Splits themselves perform there several times a day</a>. Can anyone help me out? </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splitsvile.jpg" alt="Banana Splitsvile" title="Banana Splitsvile" align="center"/></div>
<p>3.  The <a href="/2007/05/02/ben-jerrys-steals-the-banana-splits-logo/index.html">Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s Banana Split ice cream </a>changed their logo to something that does not infringe on the Splits. Hopefully photos will be coming soon. (thanks Humu for the tip!). </p>
<p>And perhaps a little less cool:  </p>
<p>4. The Banana Splits have updated their <a href="http://www.bananasplits.com/">website</a>, and recorded new videos and songs, which are on sale on iTunes, if you&#8217;re so inclined!. Sadly, they sound nothing like their old selves. </p>

<p>Before I traded in my National Geographics for <strike>Playboys</strike> Hustlers, I was a consistent reader of MAD.  What I really loved was the occasional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexi-disc">flexi-disc</a> records they&#8217;d include in their Super Specials. And the holy grail of all flexi-discs was The MAD Mystery Record. The record played &#8220;Super Spectacular Day&#8221;, a story in song that described the most absolute best day you could ever be having &#8212; <i>until</i> &#8212; the record randomly branched into one of eight different disastrous random endings. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s still clever even as an adult, but as a kid I was simply fascinated by it. How could a record have different endings? How did the record choose which one to play? I played the record over and over to hear them all and to study how it worked. Finally my Dad explained it to me: while normal records have one spiral groove per side, the MAD disc had multiple grooves spiraled together in parallel. All of the grooves had music that started off with the same beginning, so the branching appeared to happen mid-way through. But in reality it was the initial drop of the needle that determined what ending played. </p>
<p>Super Spectacular Day is a classic example of MAD&#8217;s corny humor. And of course, someone has put all eight tracks on Youtube so you can enjoy it for free (Cheap!). The actual playback of the song starts about 30 seconds in. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the Lyrics, courtesy of <a href="http://barrygoldberg.net/sillysongs/superspectacular.htm#all">barrygoldberg.net</a>, rearranged to match the order of the Youtube video:  </p>
<p>CHORUS:<br />
It&#8217;s a great big, beautiful, wonderful, incredible, super-spectacular day<br />
And your heart is humming with good times coming<br />
And you got that happy feeling things are going your way<br />
All the bells are ringing and a little bird&#8217;s singing while he sits on your windowsill<br />
Singing yessiree, I can surely see, it will plainly be, most definitely<br />
A super-spectacular day! </p>
<h3>Untilllllllll&#8230;</h3>
<p>#1<br />
&#8216;Round quarter to five your relations arrive<br />
And you greet cousin Beth with terrible breath<br />
And a fat British guy who destroys your hi-fi<br />
And your great uncle Fred who gets drunk in your bed<br />
And your third cousin Dick who is metally sick<br />
And his creepy friend Joe and six more you don&#8217;t know<br />
And you&#8217;re sure there and then as you&#8217;re shafted again&#8230;</p>
<p>#2:<br />
&#8216;Round seven at night you go out for a bite<br />
The streets are aglow from a large UFO<br />
A creature comes out with two heads and a snout<br />
It talks like a frog and throws up on your dog<br />
It thinks you are great and wants you for its mate<br />
You&#8217;re sealed in a case and go flying in space<br />
And you silently say as the Earth fades away&#8230;</p>
<p>#3:<br />
You walk out the door of a dry cleaning store<br />
And you&#8217;re grabbed by surprise by three mafia guys<br />
Who mistakenly think that you&#8217;re Hymie the Fink<br />
They break your right arm and do bodily harm<br />
And you&#8217;re writhing in pain and you try to explain<br />
That your name is Jerome and you&#8217;re on your way home<br />
And you let out a sigh as you&#8217;re left there to die&#8230;</p>
<p>#4:<br />
A quarter past eight you pick up your blind date<br />
And you really go ape for her fabulous shape<br />
Of the girls that you&#8217;ve met she&#8217;s the classiest yet<br />
And she&#8217;s pretty and bright and it&#8217;s love at first sight<br />
And it&#8217;s really a shame she&#8217;s not feeling the same<br />
&#8216;Cuz she thinks you&#8217;re a shmuck and she says &#8220;lots of luck&#8221;<br />
And you sob in despair as she gives you the air&#8230;</p>
<p>#5:<br />
You&#8217;re called down in class and you feel like an ass<br />
&#8216;Cuz you don&#8217;t have a clue and you know that it&#8217;s due<br />
To those classes you skipped and you&#8217;re fly is unzipped<br />
And your acne has spread to the back of your head<br />
And some jerk spreads the word that you&#8217;re some kind of nerd<br />
And you fight in the hall and punch through a wall<br />
And there isn&#8217;t a doubt as they&#8217;re flunking you out&#8230;</p>
<p>#6:<br />
You develop a twitch and a horrible itch<br />
And you&#8217;re covered with spots and you&#8217;re getting the trots<br />
And you&#8217;re feet start to swell and it&#8217;s easy to tell<br />
From this hideous wheeze that some awful disease<br />
So you call an M.D. and he says &#8220;don&#8217;t ask me&#8221;<br />
If it gets any worse you can speak to my nurse<br />
And you manage to say as you wither away&#8230;</p>
<p>#7:<br />
Your sister pours glue in her hair and blames you<br />
And your neighbor says that you&#8217;re abusing her cat<br />
And you just left the john with the water turned on<br />
And the house gets all wet and your mother&#8217;s upset<br />
And you&#8217;d die if you knew what your dad&#8217;s gonna do<br />
And your python gets loose and you know it&#8217;s no use<br />
And you cry there in fear and it&#8217;s now very clear&#8230;</p>
<p>#8:<br />
You go out for a spin and your sunroof caves in<br />
And the steering wheel shakes so you slam on the brakes<br />
And the gears get all stuck as you sideswipe a truck<br />
And you run out of gas while you&#8217;re trying to pass<br />
And you&#8217;re stalled on the tracks and you try to relax<br />
But the train&#8217;s coming through and it&#8217;s heading for you<br />
And you have a quick flash as you brace for the crash&#8230;.</p>
<h3>&#8230; that it’s not such a super-spectacular day!</h3>

<p>I was having dinner with a friend of mine two weeks ago, and she asked me what kind of music I listen to. In reality I listen to a lot of stuff &#8212; too diverse to lump into a single category &#8212; but for a few years now I&#8217;ve jokingly used the term <b>Electro-Acoustic  Soundscapes of the 70s</b>. (My friend Martin coined that phrase after unsuccessfully searching through my iPod for 80s music). She had no clue what kind of music I was talking about and she pressed on, so I half-seriously elaborated with &#8220;You know, electronic boops and beeps, like outer-space stuff&#8221; even though I mostly <i>don&#8217;t</i> listen to that; it&#8217;s just a small sliver of my collection. And then the conversation moved on. </p>
<p>Little did I know that the 30 seconds I spent rattling off that term would pay me back so heartily. The next week she invited me out to a bar in San Francisco and warned me not to be late.  After a quick drink, we walked down the street a few blocks until we came to an old looking wood-paneled building.</p>
<p>Opening the door revealed a museum-esque interior with a ticket booth, stationed by a very distinguished looking older woman.  We purchased two tickets at $15 each, and we&#8217;re handed two programs labeled <b>Audium: A Theatre In Sound-Sculptured Space.</b> At this point my friend tells me that she remembered me talking about electronic beeps and whooshes from the previous week, found out about this place just by blind luck, and took me here sight-unseen because she thought it might &#8220;have some of that kind of beeping stuff in it&#8221;. Little did she know how right she was. </p>
<p>We stepped into a <i>very</i> serious looking room filled with sound-related sculptures as well as an array of speakers playing ambient noise: gentle water gurgling, hummingbirds zipping from one side of the room to the other. But this was just the lobby. Clearly this place was built in the 70s, and it looked like not much had changed. And after a bit of waiting around, the ambient noises got louder and the lights in the lobby grew dim, at the same time a spotlight appeared on a wood-paneled hexagonal door, where an gray-haired gentleman appeared.  </p>
<p>He informed us and the other two dozen-or-so people in the lobby that we were about to enter the Audium, where we would be treated to a 139 speaker audio-performance-in-the-round dealing with &#8220;space and time travel&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it was going to be completely in the dark. For an hour. </p>
<p>And then we went inside. The theater itself looks as if the designers were going for <b>2001: A Space Odyssey</b> but instead ended up with a set from <b>Dr. Who</b>. It was exactly what I was hoping for. The theater is arranged in a circle, with speakers all over the place &#8230; hanging from the ceiling, built into the walls, and under grates on the floor. </p>

<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/audium.jpg" alt="Audium" title="Audium"/></div>
<p></a></p>
<p>The real kicker, however, was when the lights dimmed out to complete blackness and the experience started. The soundtrack was straight out of the 1970s and didn&#8217;t sound like it had ever been updated (although I found out later that it had). But this was not music. Electronic beeps and boops were everywhere, &#8220;flying&#8221; through air, along with droning Wagnerian-style synth power chords, abruptly shifting to lo-fi organic recordings of nature, before popping back to beeps. Despite the 139 speakers in use, most of it sounded like it was just coming out of the four big speakers in each corner. It was largely rhythmless, and had no apparent story arc or narrative that was discernible from just listening.  And the fidelity matched the decor. This was cliche 70s sci-fi art-school-project-on-drugs sound effects with a dash of the Space Mountain queue soundtrack thrown in. And it just kept going and going.  </p>
<p>Half way through the performance there was a 5 minute (lighted) intermission and half the audience left, never to return. At this point I turned to my friend and asked her if she had it in her to listen to the second half, because she had no clue going into this what she was in for, isn&#8217;t into electronic music, and even I was kinda worn out by it. But she was gung-ho for soldiering through the second half &#8230; which ended up feeling like it was twice as long as the first half. </p>
<p>After the show was over, I was in shock. An hour in the dark listening to 1970s sound effects will do that to you. A zillion questions raced through my mind. Why have I never heard of this place? How did my friend find it? How has it not changed since the 70s? Why were they still getting crowds? I desperately wanted to talk to the gray haired guy, who turns out is the founder and sound designer, but I was worried he was going to chew my already-tired ear off with space and time travel theories. </p>
<p>The entire night was a completely surreal experience. If you&#8217;re into the mid century space-age movement at all, you need to go check the Audium out before it closes or gets remodeled. Even though I didn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; what the soundtrack was about, and I thought it was a little long to sit through, I absolutely loved it and now I want to take all my friends. It&#8217;s definitely worth doing once for the sheer novelty effect even if you&#8217;re not into electronic music. But you better go soon &#8230; it really feels like it could close its doors for good any second.  </p>

<p>Audium 8 is performed every Friday and Saturday at 8:30pm. Price $15<br />
Arrive by 8 pm since part of the fun is the lobby.<br />
<em>Please double-check before showing up, I really get the feeling this can change at any time. </em></p>
<p>1616 Bush St. (@ Franklin), San Francisco<br />
Information: (415) 771-1616</p>
<p>*For the record, the 1970s electronic music I prefer is actual music, with percussion, melody, and harmony. The Audium had none of that.  And yes, I did apologize to my friend for fibbing a little about my musical tastes. </p>

&#8220;We Are Apple,&#8221; uploaded by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJy0O4UFSM">adiblasi</a></div>
<p>So, I broke down and bought an iPhone (about 20 minutes after the price drop was announced) &#8212; my first purchase of an Apple product. I didn&#8217;t even have an iPod, that&#8217;s how out if it I&#8217;ve been. Of course, now I&#8217;ve drunk the Apple Kool-Aid, and I think this phone is the greatest thing since, I dunno, the Newton. It&#8217;s fab (especially now that we&#8217;ll get some legit third-party apps soon). But this video is fabber.</p>

Make it Happen</div>
<p>This has been kicking around in low-quality form for awhile, but this version was uploaded to YouTube by someone who was at the video&#8217;s original mid-&#8217;80s presentation, and he had a high-quality copy. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hen I saw this &#8216;live&#8217; at the Mac introduction, we, as Apple Dealers, all LAUGHED OUR ASSES OFF at time marker 02:47 &#8211; when the guy carried a 60 pound LISA computer under his arm like it was a laptop!</p></blockquote>
<p>What I really want to know is &#8212; where did this wooden sign wind up? I hope it&#8217;s still up in someone&#8217;s cube in Cupertino.</p>
