		<description><![CDATA[FINALLY!  After so many (at least 30) years of hearing this song in my head, I finally get to see this cartoon.  I have often quoted the song, or thought about it in my head, especially when I see a mess around the house!  I felt like a kid again watching this video.  Thank you for posting this cherished memory for all of us to enjoy again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Rattata-tum, Rattata-tum!!! I woke up this morning not knowing why, but once again, this song was in my head. I&#039;ve been singing the praises of this cartoon my entire life, frequently quoting the Matchmakers reenactment hoping that someone would respond in recognition...only to be tsk, tsked...she must be crazy...
I have wanted to see this cartoon again for 45 years. 
Thanks for the perfect 50th birthday gift!! 
Sweet Salvation!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am 46 years old. I remember very well seeing La Petite Parade. I looked for it for several years, but couldn&#039;t find it or remember the title. I only remembered that little song that he sang when he went to the department offices.

Thanks for making it available.
