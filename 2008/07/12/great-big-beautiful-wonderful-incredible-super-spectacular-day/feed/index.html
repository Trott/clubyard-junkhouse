		<description><![CDATA[I had that one! I played it over and over again, and had some of the &quot;untils&quot; memorized. I remember being invited to bring records for a church event, and I asked about bringing this one, &quot;but some of the songs aren&#039;t good to listen to&quot; (remembering &quot;called on in class&quot;). I couldn&#039;t get them to understand that I just skipped over that one, and that the rest of it was funny, and acceptable.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Unbelievable......you have made my day! I cannot thank you enough. 
We lost the original, but wouldn&#039;t be able to play it now anyway. This is my opportunity to enjoy it again and even pass down to the kids.  Something I know they will absolutely luv and enjoy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is absolutely priceless!  Like others, I&#039;ve had this tune bouncing around my head for 30 years, and could always sing the first half perfectly but couldn&#039;t remember any of the UNTIL&#039;s in detail.  In 1990 or 1991, I actually wrote to Mad magazine asking if they had any copies they could send me--I&#039;d long since lost mine.  I got a letter from William Gaines himself, saying sorry, it sure was popular, all sold out!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been singing parts of that song since I got that issue in 80 at age 14. Nobody knows that song and looks at me like I&#039;m crazy. Thank you thank you thank you for putting the words here, I couldn&#039;t remember all of them. Now I can sing it to my wife who thinks I&#039;m crazy anyway. Again thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I went to sleep last night with this song in my head and had to see if I could find it and here it was!  Thanks be to the internet!  I really wish I still had this record.  It&#039;s wild to think about how novel this really was.  And how catchy.  I like the previous quote about the Goodfellas cast.  Much thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One day my 5 year old said, &quot;Dad can you sing me a song?&quot; And so without even thinking, I started out with the first 1/2 of the song, getting all of the lyrics exact, but I never remembered the &quot;Until&quot;s very well. Thanks so much for keeping this alive! My 8 year old loves it! His brother can&#039;t quite understand the &quot;until&quot;s, but we&#039;re having fun with it regardless...Thanks again!]]></description>
