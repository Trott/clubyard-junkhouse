		<description><![CDATA[Hello!  I live in Las Vegas, which is technically closer than Phoenix, if you are indeed willing to mail it, which I suspect you aren&#039;t.  If I can find a way to San Francisco before Halloween and you haven&#039;t found a more suitable borrower, I&#039;d like to put in for it.  I once gained 15 pounds in a semester (in college) almost entirely from eating bacon.  Sometimes whole packages.  I have had a bacon party.  And I identify religiously as a Bacon Jew.  

Lovely costume, wonderful work.  

Have a great day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello! So... are you still lending out your bacon costume? I&#039;m having a reunion with my two favorite girlfriends in Portland, OR for Halloween, and we&#039;re going to be a BLT. I get to be the bacon! :)  (It was so kind of them to nominate me.) Would you be willing to mail your costume to Phoenix, AZ?

Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi - I love the fact that you were bacon.  I thought of the idea on my own and found your blog when I was looking to buy a costume.  I totally get why you made your own - the professional ones are lame.  

So I&#039;m looking forward to making my own. So I have couple of queations for you:
1) Where did you find a foam shop (I live in the Bay Area too)?
2) Is there any specific kind of paint that you recommend?

Thanks!  I can&#039;t wait to send you photos (I&#039;m going to be crispy!).
