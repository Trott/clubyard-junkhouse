        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/puffy-e-t-stickers.jpg" alt="Puffy E.T. stickers" title="Puffy E.T. stickers" height=504 width=288 /><br />
Puffy E.T. stickers</div>
<p>Okay, these cracked up my proverbial shit. Over at <a href="http://ilovethisworld.com/?p=2594">I Love This World</a>, René got these knockoff puffy E.T The Extra Terrestrial stickers for just $2 on eBay. $2! That&#8217;s what I call value. I mean, let&#8217;s take a look at these for a moment:</p>
<p>It all starts off as you might expect, with E.T. bopping merrily along in his glowy spaceship, apparently rocking out to some groovy tuneage on his totally boss headphones (with two antennae!). </p>
<p>Then, we learn that E.T. is a lefty, as he veges out in front of his favorite video game, with his unused right hand to his lips in pensive thought. But he doesn&#8217;t have the look of your standard tensed-up, video game-obsessed teen&#8230; no, his look is almost wistful, as if this game reminds him of a summer spent on the far side of his home planet&#8230; and he&#8217;s inspired to softly whistle a merry tune. I like this softer side of E.T.</p>
<p>Why, here&#8217;s another side of E.T. I like! It&#8217;s Get-Down Disco E.T.! He has got <i>all</i> the moves, and he wants you to come shake it with him! Come on, there&#8217;s a party in E.T.&#8217;s bathroom, and you&#8217;re invited! It&#8217;s BYOBathrobe, baby!</p>
<p>Whew! That&#8217;s quite a sweat we worked up, so now it&#8217;s time to get tidy. E.T. knows that all the good little boys &#038; girls &#038; whatevers need to scrub down, especially under their armpits. </p>
<p>Awwww&#8230; E.T. wants to show you his favorite panda. Hello, E.T.&#8217;s favorite panda! What a lucky panda you are to have such a friend.</p>
<p>HOLY CRAP. I&#8217;m sorry, I did not see this coming. The knockoff puffy sticker people killed E.T.! Or, at least hooked him up to some serious Muppet Labs-caliber equipment, so you know the best case scenario is that his head is going to explode. </p>
<p>Poor E.T. Such a fun-loving guy. Why couldn&#8217;t we just let him be? Why must we humans always kill what we do not understand? Thank you, knockoff puffy stickers, for showing me that sometimes an alien can be the better human. I am changed.</p>
<p>And now, I&#8217;m really, really wishing that I still had my E.T. latchwork pillow kit from when I was 8. Why-oh-why didn&#8217;t I find the wherewithal to finish it? I could be an eBay HUNDREDAIRE!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve been pestered by a few friends, and some strangers (Hi Books Inc!) to post my paper wallets. See, I make these wallets, out of paper, then use them till they almost fall apart, and then make new ones. For over 10 years now. And I&#8217;ve been meaning to post them here when they&#8217;re all shiny and new; before they slowly get dinged up and torn; before they conform to the shape of my ass. But the problem is when I make a new one, I almost always forget to take photos. And when I remember to take photos, I get so picky about the lighting and background and the angles that the photos never get taken. </p>
<p>But in the spirit of getting shit done and moving on, I present to you crappy photos of my previous two paper wallets, taken today, on my desk under the yellow light of my <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/11/30/knex-lamp/">K&#8217;nex lamp</a>, with the bare minimum effort put into setting up the shots.</p>
<p>Today we have two paper wallets. </p>
<h3>60s Legs Paper Wallet</h3>
<p><b>NOTE: At the time these photos were taken, the wallet&#8217;s seen a few months of wear and tear, and is looking a little weathered not unlike an off-the-strip Vegas cocktail waitress (Sorry mom! No offense!), but when it was new it looked fly.</b></p>
<p>This wallet was made out of two extra-long postcards I found in some gift store. I thought legs would make a great theme.  I was wrong. Still I like how it turned out, and it has only offended a few so far. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet-001.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet-002.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<h3>North Woods Inn Paper Wallet</h3>
<p><b>NOTE: At the time these photos were taken, the wallet was so badly worn that I retired it (and made the Legs wallet above), so it&#8217;s looking a bit like the box to a &#8220;We swear it works fine&#8221; returned digital camera at Fry&#8217;s. When it was new, it looked <i>badass</i>.</b></p>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.clearmansrestaurants.com/northwoods.html">Clearman&#8217;s North Woods Inn</a>.  A lot. It is so fantastic it deserves it&#8217;s own post here. But here&#8217;s the Cliff Notes: The North Woods Inn is a themed family restaurant in Southern California that takes it&#8217;s cue from the rustic romanticism of the snow dusted Klondike.  It&#8217;s a big log cabin (and by big I mean freaking huge) with permanent, fiberglass snow on it&#8217;s rooftop. The place has not changed since it opened in the 60s &#8230; but is has also not fallen into disrepair. It looks pretty much like I imagine it looked like on opening day; preserved in time perhaps better than Disneyland. The food is good, the service is friendly, and the crowd has real appeal &#8212; multiple generations of families gathering to celebrate good report cards and new drivers licenses. I ate lunch there on a Sunday and must have heard Happy Birthday (sung to the real tune of Happy Birthday) and Happy Anniversary (also sung to the real tune of Happy Birthday) at least thirty times. </p>
<p>Anyway, at the gift shop I picked up a couple of North Woods Inn pint glasses, and a set of North Woods Inn steak knives, and of course some of these fancy North Woods Inn postcards, which I used to make perhaps my favoriteist wallet of them all: the North Woods Inn Paper Wallet. </p>
<p>I need to make a new one of these soon.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-002.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-001.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>Wait! Here&#8217;s some photos I just found when the wallet was pretty new, and I took it back to the motherland to be reunited with cheese toast, their famous &#8220;two salads&#8221;, and a stein of Molson (okay, okay, it was probably Anchor Steam):</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-003.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>And now for the reverse angle: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-004.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>I hope to post more, with better pictures, as I make new ones. And there&#8217;s a whole story about <i>why</i> I started making them in the first place. Watch this space for more!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Thanksgiving I had my family over and my nephew was mesmerized by my <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/11/27/knex-coffee-table-end-table/">K’nex end table</a>. I think he loved the idea that a grown-up had used toys to make something so functional and had it proudly displayed in the house. He asked if I had any more K’nex left over because he wanted to play with them. I dug my box of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K'NEX">K’nex</a> parts out of the closet for him, and it got me thinking about building with K’nex again. The table was the only thing I had made with it, and that was over ten years ago.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/ikea-lamp.jpg" alt="ikea-lamp" title="ikea-lamp"/><br />The light element<br />used in the lamp.</div>
<p>A few nights later I found myself sleepless again and in the mood for some good old fashioned pen-on-paper writing and illustration. Normally I’d do that during the day at a coffee shop, but it was late and I found myself without a desk lamp! I rummaged through my lighting box looking for something suitable and came across a little IKEA-style accent light.</p>
<p>Immediately I thought of rigging up something with K’nex to hold it in the air so that I wouldn’t get long shadows when writing. A few hours later the first version of the K’nex lamp was complete. Of course, by then the mood to write had passed. The next day I spent a few more hours refining and improving it. It’s stands about two feet tall. Like the table, it uses no glue.   </p>

<p>The K&#8217;nex coffee table / end table is my own creation dating back to 1995. It was very late at night and, as usual, I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I had needed a coffee table for quite some time but hadn&#8217;t gotten around to buying one. I did however, have a huge collection of K&#8217;nex toys. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.knex.com/">K&#8217;nex</a> is like a plastic version of Tinkertoys, with two basic types of pieces: rods and connectors. They snap together and their sizes are mathematically designed to make triangles and boxes and whatnot. Unlike LEGO, the color of a K&#8217;nex piece determines it&#8217;s type, for example all the rods of one color are the same length. This means creating something with specific colors is somewhat of a challenge. K&#8217;nex pieces fit together pretty snugly, &#8212; in fact, after playing with them for a few hours my fingers hurt from all the pressure needed to connect and disconnect them. </p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/knex-end-table-004.jpg" alt="K'nex End Table" title="K'nex End Table"/></div>
<p>So, back to that sleepless night. I had a disassembled K&#8217;Nex kit of the <a href="http://orgs.bloomu.edu/msc/Center%20Stuff/K'NEX%20Pictures/K'Nex%20Ball%20Factory%20(large).jpg">Big Ball Factory</a>. There were a lot of pieces in it. I figured there were probably enough to make a decent coffee table. I didn&#8217;t realize the task I was taking on though; because designing a table that won&#8217;t sag in the middle or collapse when any kind of serious <a href="http://www.willbeta.com/lose-weight-exercise/"><span style="display:none;">Lose </span>Weight<span style="display:none;"> Exercise</span></a> is put on it is a challenge. While building it I had to redesign it several times to make it strong enough. The sun was up when I finished, and the table stood proud at 5 feet long and 1.2 feet tall. It uses no glue, but it holds a lot of <a href="http://www.willbeta.com/lose-weight-exercise/"><span style="display:none;">Lose </span>Weight<span style="display:none;"> Exercise</span></a>. I never got photos of it in this configuration. </p>
<p>A few years later I moved to a new location and decided what I really needed was an end table. So I took a bit out of the middle, and increased the height of the legs, and the coffee table was transformed into an end table. It&#8217;s now about 2 feet tall and 2.5 feet wide. Every once in a while I&#8217;ll clean it and fix a few disconnected rods. I use it like a real table, and it works fine. It uses no glass, but the surface works well even though it&#8217;s got plenty of holes. Containers with non-flat bottoms like Coke or water bottles need a coaster, and that&#8217;s about it for special treatment. Although it&#8217;s been through a  lot (including the ire of disapproving tastemakers) it has never collapsed.  Enjoy the photos. -Hanford</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I hope the music was at least half as good as the cover art &#8212; way groovy:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/65426141"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/the-quests-go-go-requests.jpg" alt="The Quests' Go Go Requests" title="The Quests' Go Go Requests" height=509 width=500 /></a><br />
The Quests&#8217; Go Go ReQuests</div>
<p>A post on <a href="http://robotactionboy.wordpress.com/2007/05/02/1330/">Robot Action Boy</a> pointed me to this <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/the_record_collection&#038;page=all">treasure trove of Asian pop album covers from the &#8217;60s and &#8217;70s</a>. Good god, they just keep going and going&#8230; and every last one has got some kind of crazy-cool thing about it. </p>
<p>The Quests&#8217; <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/65426141"><i>Go Go ReQuests</i></a> album (pictured above) &#8212; well, you can see for yourself how fabulous it is. One of the songs on the album is &#8220;Ding Dong Twist,&#8221; which sounds like either a new Hostess snack product, or an obscene gesture. <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/68851593"><i>Sing Along With the Christones</i></a> features a band of young, hip, Asian priests &#8212; each wearing one of those little white &#038; black priest collar things. <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/70589462"><i>Four Hits</i></a>, also from the Quests, has a very soulful-looking pointing finger on the cover &#8212; appropriately, to illustrate their song &#8220;Soul Finger.&#8221; Now, that&#8217;s a song I want to hear.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/74455206"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/off-beat-cha-cha.jpg" alt="Off Beat Cha Cha" title="Off Beat Cha Cha" height=199 width=200 /></a><br />
Off Beat Cha Cha</div>
<p>Some of the albums look funky, like they may be soundtracks to obscure Thaispoitation films&#8230; others look like the Ravi Shankar&#8217;s schtick re-arrived back home after being filtered through the Beatles&#8230; and lots are clearly light, fluffy Go-Go dancing frothiness, complete with smiling, happy girls. Well, except for <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/image/74455206"><i>Off Beat Cha Cha</i></a>, which has three girls who are clearly dancing under court order and are miserable about it.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t take my word for it, go check out the <a href="http://www.pbase.com/sid_presley/the_record_collection&#038;page=all">entire gallery of albums</a> for yourself at David Greenfield&#8217;s photo site.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JYC EXCLUSIVE: Yesterday Humu and I were strolling down the frozen dessert aisle of Whole Foods when we both spotted a new Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s flavor: Banana Split. We noticed immediately how the logo on the ice cream container was a spot-on copy of the Hanna-Barbera <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_splits">Banana Splits</a> band logo, minus the last S in the word &#8220;Splits&#8221;. Just compare the Banana Split package to the cover of the Banana Splits album I have: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splits-logo.jpg" alt="Banana Splits logo" title="Banana Splits logo"/><br />Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream on the left; Album from the 1960s band Banana Splits on the right</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closeup of both logos: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splits-logo-closeup.jpg" alt="Banana Splits logo closeup" title="Banana Splits logo closeup"/></div>
<p>Since Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s are (A) known for exploiting the nostalgia of the 60s to sell ice cream, and (B) unforgiving in their endless barrage of shameless product tie-ins, I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them to license the classic bubble-gum band to shill for them. I&#8217;m sure the Splits would do it. </p>
<p>I picked up the carton and scanned the entire package to see if there was any credit or trademark assignment to Hanna-Barbera, who signed the Banana Splits supergroup to their label and gave them a show back in the 1970s. I <i>did</i> find a copyright notice for the cow illustration that appears on the back of the carton, but I found nothing to indicate that Ben and Jerry&#8217;s had licensed the Banana Splits logo. </p>
<p>Is is possible that Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s is the most recent company to pull a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Goldman">Todd Goldman</a> and appropriate someone else&#8217;s art to pass off as their own? I contacted Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s to find out more, but I have not heard back from them yet. So I decided to go straight to the source and talk to the Banana Splits themselves. </p>
<h3>Not The First Time</h3>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/bingo-from-the-banana-splits.jpg" alt="Bingo from the Banana Splits" title="Bingo from the Banana Splits"/></div>
<p>I got in touch Bingo, the enigmatic second-banana of the Banana Splits (although most music scholars agree he was the &#8220;John Lennon&#8221; of the group), for his comments. Perhaps not surprisingly, he was unaware of the situation. Like most bands from the 70s, the Splits signed over all of their rights to their record label in exchange for fame and fortune, and lost control of their image. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have no say any more, and Hanna-Barbera doesn&#8217;t really care about us. They cater to your every whim if you can make them some coin, but once the money stops coming in, they forget about you! It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re <i>off the bus</i>&#8221; Bingo commented. &#8220;And so they just let golden opportunities like this slip past them. This is not the first time it has happened. We&#8217;ve been trying for years to get royalties from Bob Marley&#8217;s estate, who lifted the chorus melody of <i>Buffalo Soldier</i> directly from our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbU5CzPi0zM">theme song</a>. But Hanna-Barbera just hasn&#8217;t bothered. They don&#8217;t realize the gold mine they&#8217;re sitting on&#8221;  Bingo lamented. He then hit me in the face with a pie. </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the verdict? Well, the jury is still out on this one, so stick with us here at JYC for full scoop (har har) as this story unfolds. If I see that Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s is planning a <a href="http://www.wingnuttoons.com/Banana_Conf.html">Sour Grape</a> flavor, you will be the first to know. </p>

Walt Disney&#8217;s passport</div>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s 1965 passport is <a href="http://cgi.liveauctions.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;viewitem=&#038;item=170096789923">up for sale on eBay</a>. He died just a year and a half after it was issued, and its only use was for a trip to London. The UK premiere of Mary Poppins was on August 23, 1965, just four days after this passport was issued, and that seems a likely use, but the London arrival stamp isn&#8217;t shown, and the New York return stamp says September 29. It&#8217;s currently at $3,600, and is estimated to close in the neighborhood of $14,400-$21,600 when the auction ends on Saturday.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, your gamble in the candy aisle of a Chinese market pays off&#8230; sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. Not everybody loves haw flakes, but I&#8217;m a fan. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/mmmm-haw.jpg" alt="Mmmm... haw" title="Mmmm... haw" height=344 width=500 /><br />
Mmmm&#8230; haw</div>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/contains-haw-sugar-water-and-d.jpg" alt="Contains haw, sugar, water and dye. But mostly haw." title="Contains haw, sugar, water and dye. But mostly haw." height=150 width=150 /><br />
Contains haw, sugar,<br />
water and red dye.<br />
But mostly haw.</div>
<p>What are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haw_flakes">haw flakes</a>, you ask? Why, they&#8217;re flakes. Made out of haw. Just like it says on the package. They may look like firecrackers, but they&#8217;re a delightful candy treat. Each roll has a couple dozen super-thin wafers of hawiness. They look like monochrome Necco wafers, and taste and feel somewhat like a desiccated Fruit Roll-Up. I think they are delicious, but a few people have said they &#8220;taste like ass.&#8221; Most people seem to like them, though. Even if you don&#8217;t go for the taste, the packaging is so colorful and fun, they&#8217;re hard to resist. Unless you&#8217;re just really disappointed that they aren&#8217;t really firecrackers.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/haw-flakes-in-the-buff.jpg" alt="Haw flakes, in the buff" title="Haw flakes, in the buff" height=277 width=200 /><br />
Haw flakes, in the buff</div>
<p>They are dirt cheap &#8212; possibly literally. I used to work for a dirt company, and dirt can get pretty pricey. As I said, each roll comes with a couple dozen wafers, and ten of those rolls come in a pack. I bought a bag of about a half-dozen packs for just a couple bucks. That&#8217;s somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,400 flakes. I don&#8217;t understand how that is possible, what with all the elaborate packaging involved, and the shipping halfway across the globe. I would love to see pictures of a haw flake factory, they&#8217;re probably lots of fun to watch in action.</p>
<p>I brought some with me to <a href="http://www.forbiddenislandalameda.com">Forbidden Island</a> last week (that&#8217;s our favorite bar, we tend to be there on Wednesdays), and they were a big hit. I might try crumbling some up into some Schnapps of some sort, and call it Hawschläger.</p>

Pee&amp;Poo tattoos</div>
<p>Decades of forward-thinking Scandinavian design have finally reached their pinnacle in this: <a href="http://www.peeandpoo.com">Pee&#038;Poo</a>. Called Kiss&#038;Bajs in their native Swedish, these lil&#8217; darlins of the toilet world are the creation of Emma Megitt. There&#8217;s a whole line of products, including plush toys, keychains, underpants, socks (?) and t-shirts, for both kids and adults. Strangely, no potty training books &#8212; I guess this is just Pee&#038;Poo for pee &#038; poo&#8217;s sake, which I can kind of understand. </p>
<p>The strangest product has to be this set of traditional sailor-style Pee&#038;Poo Tattoos, with skulls and crossbones (in the shape of a deceased Pee and Poo), anchors, and toilet paper banners. My favorite thing about Pee&#038;Poo, though, is their Pee&#038;Poo rainbow. I want one painted on the wall of my bathroom, with the end landing right on the terlet.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/29/you-can-be-bobby-darin-and-ill-be-sandra-dee/#comment-152">a comment on the Bobby Darin post</a>, I was prompted by the always-on-it-like-a-bonnet <a href="http://www.mrbalihai.com/goof/">Mr. Bali Hai</a> to ask my friend <a href="http://www.jimcherry.com">Jim Cherry</a> about his cars-of-the-future book project, <a href="http://www.cartopia.us">Cartopia</a>. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/predicta-the-personal-car-with.jpg" alt="Predicta, the Personal Car With a Hint of Tomorrow" title="Predicta, the Personal Car With a Hint of Tomorrow" height=242 width=500 /><br />

Science and Mechanics magazine cover</div>
<p>A funny coincidence &#8212; it just so happens that Jim Cherry met with Taschen this afternoon to sign the deal for the book. It turned out the agreement paperwork needed a little work, so it&#8217;s not actually a signed deal yet, but it&#8217;s &#8220;definitely on.&#8221; Taschen has turned out some real beauts over the years, so it&#8217;s great to see them taking this one on. They want Jim to expand the book to include futuristic prototype cars from throughout the 20th century, so it&#8217;s going to be an even bigger book than he thought, and he gets to make some field trips to Detroit to hit the manufacturers&#8217; archives. No word yet on a release date, but a rough draft is scheduled to be done by August, so maybe early 2008? Congratulations, Jim!</p>
<p>To tide you over until Cartopia the book arrives, spend some time at <a href="http://www.cartopia.us">Cartopia the website</a> &#8212; there&#8217;s a trunkload of great midcentury images of futuristic cars, including advertisements, magazine covers and even toy models.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I adore some of the signage used on apartment buildings during the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s. Here are some great signs I saw just today in Mountain View, CA:</p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/the-elena-apartments-001.jpg" alt="The Elena Apartments" title="The Elena Apartments" height=227 width=300 /></div>
<p>I was doing a lot of &#8220;this one&#8217;s my favorite! no, wait, this one&#8217;s my favorite! oh, wait, <i>this</i> one&#8230;.&#8221; etc, etc today&#8230; but this one might really be my favorite. Today. Of the ones on that block. On that side of the street. I think. No matter &#8212; it&#8217;s clearly fantastic. It was also one of the better-maintained buildings, and looked fresh as a daisy. The lettering is just gorgeous &#8212; I especially love the combination of the scripty &#8220;Elena&#8221; with the staid &#8220;the&#8221; and &#8220;apts&#8221;. Tres elegant. But of course the real standout here are those lovely poodle bushes. I do so love poodle bushes.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/king-apartments.jpg" alt="King apartments" title="King apartments" height=208 width=300 /></div>
<p>I love it when the lettering is really and truly unique. I think that great big fat pancake of a dot hovering over the &#8220;i&#8221; is great, and I really like the added touch of the flag-points at the end of the letters. Very regal.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/casa-del-rey-apartments.jpg" alt="Casa del Rey apartments" title="Casa del Rey apartments" height=198 width=300 /></div>
<p>The lettering on this one is relatively common &#8212; don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s gorgeous, and head &#038; shoulders over dull modern signage. But I really grabbed this picture because I love the dramatic entryway, and that beautiful scrollwork globe light fixture. The whole look together is <i>very</i> fancy.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/sharron-apartments.jpg" alt="Sharron apartments" title="Sharron apartments" height=130 width=300 /></div>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/sharron-apartments-exterior.jpg" alt="Sharron apartments exterior" title="Sharron apartments exterior" height=62 width=200 /></div>
<p>This one gets a B+ on the sign, and a C- on the building &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen military installations that were more inviting. Maybe it&#8217;s nicer once you&#8217;re past the fort-like exterior.<br clear=both /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/el-portal-apartments.jpg" alt="El Portal apartments" title="El Portal apartments" height=363 width=300 /></div>
<p>This is my other favorite of today&#8217;s apartments. Spanish-inspired architecture is still novel and exotic for me, and probably always will be &#8212; you don&#8217;t see a lot of it in Seattle. You can&#8217;t see the detail on those doors, but you can probably imagine it, and those light fixtures! Oh, I am a sucker for amber glass and ironwork. This is the kind of place I can see myself living in; it&#8217;s the kind of place I think of when I think of California. And I adore California. Completely.<br clear=left /><br />
If you&#8217;d like to see more and bigger pictures of these buildings, I&#8217;ve got a whole mess of them up at <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/aptsmar07/">Humuhumu&#8217;s Life in Photos</a>.</p>

Dale Sizer pretends he&#8217;s Bobby</div>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.jimcherry.com">Jim Cherry</a> just went on a tour of Bobby Darin&#8217;s midcentury Hollywood Hills home, and he wrote up the <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=1111868&#038;blogID=246884918&#038;MyToken=3b078fdb-4540-45f9-a90e-4b1d3a2869b1">tour with photos</a> in a recent blog post on his MySpace. Dale Sizer, who happened to be mentioned in <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/29/bobbing-along-on-the-bottom-of-the-beautiful-briny-sea/">my post earlier today</a>, was also there to check out the digs.</p>
<p>The house is at 1411 Rising Glen Road, and has 5 bedrooms, 3.5 baths. Jim reports that it&#8217;s relatively un-mucked with. It&#8217;s being offered for just shy of 3.7M. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.1411risingglen.com/">property&#8217;s website</a>, with a full photo tour.</p>

Vintage plaster fish, from Bowling Trophy</div>
<p>These are just some of the lovely <a href="http://bowlingtrophy.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/thrift-item-of-the-moment/">vintage plaster wall fish</a> that have been posted on the new blog, <a href="http://bowlingtrophy.wordpress.com/">Bowling Trophy</a>. There&#8217;s no name attached to the blog, but if it is who I think it is, then his one-two punch of excellent photography skills matched with uncanny thrifting ability should combine into a really swell blog.</p>

Bedknobs and Broomsticks</div>
<p>I think these fish are great; they often have really great shaded paint jobs that make them look almost like sugar candy or marzipan. Their happy and alluring demeanor always reminds me of the underwater sequence in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R9A4/103-7055025-7579835?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=hukoti-20&#038;linkCode=xm2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creativeASIN=B00004R9A4">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a>. </p>

<p>My friend Dale Sizer did <a href="http://www.timbiskup.com/NewPages/lot10.html">this cool painting of plaster wall fish</a> on a slice of a log a few years ago.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="http://www.scaryideas.com/print/2011/">Scary Ideas</a>, these coasters were placed in popular bars throughout Mumbai by the Mumbai Traffic Police, as a reminder of the dangers of driving drunk.

Bloody coasters from Mumbai</div>
<p>The coasters were printed using a special red dye that only appears when the coaster gets wet &#8212; so when a drink&#8217;s condensation runs down the glass to the coaster, it creates a ring of blood. Yowzers! </p>
<p>This is a pretty good, if unsettling, use &#8212; I wonder if we&#8217;ll see this special dye used again in a more jovial form at Halloween. [via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/03/21/mumbais_bleeding_dri.html">BoingBoing</a>]</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hanford just picked up this little plastic puppy:</p>

So very wee!</div>
<p>It&#8217;s <i>really</i> little &#8212; you can see me holding it in my fingers here &#8212; and I&#8217;ve got teeny fingers. He found it in one of those coin-operated kiddie machines, and got it for two quarters. This thing is just insanely detailed. I&#8217;ve got it blown way up in that picture above so you can see all the little features. The eyes and nose are painted on, and they&#8217;re just perfect. The fur, the mouth, the ears &#8212; every detail is meticulously defined. Fifty cents goes a long way in the puppy-crafting trade, apparently.</p>

<p>I love midcentury futurism names. I dig on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinerama">Cinerama</a>, and I can&#8217;t get enough juice from the Juice-o-matic. I named my game studio <a href="http://www.monolux.com/">Monolux</a>, I named my feedback system the Suggestomatic, and I named my game&#8217;s serial number generator the Tabulatron.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found an Architectural Digest from 1959 a while back in an antique mall, and naturally it has some fantastic images of midcentury design. This one is quite possibly my favorite: the office of Mr. McCulloch, the head honcho at <a href="http://www.mccullochpower.com">McCulloch Corporation</a>. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/mr-mccullochs-private-office.jpg" alt="Mr. McCulloch's Private Office, from a 1959 Architectural Digest" title="Mr. McCulloch's Private Office, from a 1959 Architectural Digest" height=430 width=500 /><br />
Mr. McCulloch&#8217;s Private Office, from a 1959 Architectural Digest</div>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/the-nerve-center.jpg" alt="The nerve center" title="The nerve center" height=288 width=300 /><br />
The nerve center</div>
<p>The space was designed for McCulloch by the famed modern designer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3">Paul Laszlo</a>, and it&#8217;s really quite beautiful. I can&#8217;t tell from the pictures what the details are on the wall, but there was some sort of tiled design that must have been stunning.</p>
<p>But the real star of the photo is clearly this desk. It&#8217;s just out of this world! Check out those three clunky handsets, each with its own hidey-hole for the cord (I&#8217;m sure the cords were tangled in a heap on the floor in no time) and awkwardly placed rotary dial. And the drawers! Someone most likely hand-painted these labels on each one, in that beautiful lettering. The desk is so stuffy and proud to be corporate &#8212; we&#8217;re across the nation now, you know! We&#8217;ve got <em>regions</em>! And that CLASSIFIED drawer, trying to look nonchalant between WESTERN and SOUTHERN. </p>
<p>I also love the giant, menacing portraits on the wall&#8230; they look more like somber, elfin, former McCulloch presidents than the president&#8217;s children. </p>
