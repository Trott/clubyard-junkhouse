		<description><![CDATA[Why, thank you! Glad you like it!

We&#039;ve been using our Bindleflop regularly for the past month now, and we love it. I still feel like a pack mule when carrying a bunch of groceries, but now I&#039;m a pack mule with &lt;i&gt;free hands&lt;/i&gt;. It makes all the difference in the world, I love it.

If you&#039;ve got an unused or little-used laptop case sitting around, you&#039;ve got to make a Bindleflop!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On the first question: I&#039;m afraid I&#039;m knee-deep in Silicon Valley. 

Re: flask drinking... I tend to avoid places where one has to drink covertly... I spend most of my time in &lt;a href=http://blog.humuhumu.com rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;tiki bars&lt;/a&gt;. But I&#039;m quite sure I could handle a flask. I do, after all, subscribe to &lt;a href=http://www.moderndrunkardmagazine.com/ rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Modern Drunkard&lt;/a&gt;.

Love your blog, btw!]]></description>
