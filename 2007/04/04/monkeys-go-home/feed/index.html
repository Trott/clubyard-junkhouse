		<description><![CDATA[This is one of my four or five favorite movies of all time, along with Gladiator and African Queen.  I know, somewhat of an odd trio of films.  But its light, funny, happy and takes me to a place completely free of worries.  Plus it has that incredible smile of Yvette Mimieux!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Seeing as Tim is now 66 years old, I think I&#039;ll be steering clear of both him and his monkey (if he has one.) Now if he were thirty years younger... I have been known to do some very stupid things for very cute guys.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ha ha... I was wondering which would win out, the monkey-hate or the Disney-love.

What would you do if Tim Considine asked you to watch his monkey? (And not in a euphemism-y way.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m embarrassed to admit that despite my much touted hatred of monkeys, I actually own the novel that the movie was based on. Strangely, I also own The Misadventures of Merlin Jones and The Monkeys Uncle on VHS. (I adored Annette Funicello when I was in my twenties. I think it&#039;s because she always managed to end up with Tim Considine. He was a 1950s teen hottie.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again? Honey, I&#039;ve got a Disney glue feedbag stapled to my head.

I haven&#039;t seen Monkey&#039;s Uncle yet, but I want to. I&#039;ve got the theme song on one of my Disney compilations, and I&#039;ve caught myself singing it on more than one occasion. I generally have a no-monkey-movies rule, but I made an exception for Monkeys, Go Home! because the title is almost a double-dog-dare for monkey movie haters. And I am weak in the face of such masterful playground posturing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why can&#039;t I inherit an olive farm in the south of France? I think I vaguely recall seeing this movie as a kid. Or maybe I&#039;m thinking of The Monkey&#039;s Uncle. In any case, thanks for the memories.]]></description>
