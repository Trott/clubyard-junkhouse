		<description><![CDATA[I have both of the Baker&#039;s Cut Up Cakes booklets.  The first one is copyrighted 1956 and features a different cake for each month of the year!  The witch for October is especially endearing.  When I was young, my mother made a cut up cake for just about every birthday for my brothes, sisters and I!  I am so pleased to have both booklets now!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This book brings back memories of my childhood.   Back when playing outside all day was the norm.  Back before the days of mega-birthday parties for children.   Back when mommies stayed at home and baked and cooked from scratch. 

Now, I have a granddaughter and I think that one of these cakes would be perfect for her birthday!

Thank you!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This booklet as old as me and I have it. (It was my Mom&#039;s).  I don&#039;t remember her making cakes from it, but I remember pouring over it regularly and dreaming of them.  I&#039;m baking a cake to become the fish as we speak.

There&#039;s only two circus animals .. the lion on the cover and an elephant.  There&#039;s also a giraffe, but I don&#039;t know if that qualifies.

I think my mother-in-law had (has?) a different one.  She makes the big easter bunny face cake that she claims came from that book.

In any case, the whole book is reproduced here: http://www.artbaxter.com/esoterica-pages/bakers_coconut-index.html, so you can find the cutout patterns.]]></description>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I made most of these cut up cakes when my children were growing up in 1950&#8242;s through 1970&#8242;s.  I have another Baker&#8217;s Coconut cut-up cake book that is by the month, but I have lost the cover to it.  Would like to know the date it was put out.<br />
Thanks, Bonnie Rauch</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi  I have this one plus two others bakers company published. I have one from 1956,1967 similar cutouts but some new ones. Like everyone else born in 1960 these were the only cakes my Mom made for our b-days. I will pass these on to my girls I hope they get the enjoyment my mom did. The good old days!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, it was my 45th birthday and I wanted to make the Hobby Horse cake for the party.  When I was a little girl my aunt would make different shaped cakes for all of the kids birthdays.  I would love to get a copy of this the booklet.  It brings back great memories.  I did make the horse cake and everybody thought I got it from a fancy bakery.  Lots of fun.  I really would like to get this book and the others that went with a set.  Can you help me?

Thank you,
Sara]]></description>
