		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for posting such lovely pictures of Haw Flakes. Great memories as a kid in the 1960s/70s eating them. What brought me to you was Google search for &quot;Hong Kong candy&quot; as I couldn&#039;t remember the name. Homemade quince paste (membrillo)seriously reminds me of Haw Flakes flavor.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haw Flakes are the best. 10 rolls cost about a $1.25. The taste is interesting, and they are addicting! I just finished up a few rolls, and I may eat some more. High five to the FLAKES!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[If you like the flavor of haw, you might also like Palapa Azul hibiscus sorbet -- it&#039;s yummy! I tore through a pint of the stuff a few days ago, after finding it at Whole Foods. I thought the flavor was really similar to haw flakes (only much more fresh &amp; delicious, of course).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I was in the 7th grade it was thought they the reason they were so cheap was they were made out of flavored saw dust, I think it was because &quot;Haw&quot; sounded like &quot;Saw&quot; and if you ate them you were off. I always thought they were made out of opium since they came in a bag of 10 rolls and you couldn&#039;t stop eating the damn things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe you just did a write up on Haw Flakes!  I used to EXIST on these things.  Back in &quot;small kid time&quot; (as we say in Hawaii) we didn&#039;t have ice cream trucks, we had shave ice trucks.  Without fail the cheapest food item on the truck was the Haw Flakes.  I think they cost either a nickel or a dime each.  With my handful of saved lunch money I could either get 1 shave ice, or 30 or so haw flakes.  I think you know what I bought every time! :)  I have always yearned to see the Haw in its natural (un-waferized) form.]]></description>
