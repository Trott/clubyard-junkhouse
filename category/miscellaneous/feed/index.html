        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m a huge fan of awkwardly sincere music and artwork, especially when it&#8217;s bad. I lit up when I came across Cartoon Brew&#8217;s discovery of <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/comics/worst-comic-strip-ever">Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy</a>. Man, even the name is klunky. </p>
<p>Most of strips have a gag in them that almost always fails to deliver, like these: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy-001.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy-004.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
</p>
<p>While others just kinda play out incoherently: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy-002.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
<p>But my favorite moments in these strips are when the author clearly just gives up. In this strip, you can see the author clearly thought he had something with &#8220;snow bank&#8221;, but makes Chumpy mirror the author&#8217;s own ineptitude by simply declaring &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it but &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy-003.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
<p>And nothing screams &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to put any effort into my gag&#8221; than a word balloon full of &#8220;blah blah blah&#8221;s: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/uncle-funny-bunny-and-chumpy-005.jpg" alt="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" title="Uncle Funny Bunny and Chumpy" align="center"/></div>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s something about this strip that just makes me smile when I read them.  It kinda reminds me of my own short-lived comic strip, <a href="http://www.toondoo.com/View.toon?param=7830">Nuknuk and Piney</a>. </p>
<p>Check out the rest of the scans on <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/comics/worst-comic-strip-ever">Cartoon Brew</a>. </p>

<p>I had a last-second idea for a super-quick Halloween costume: the Gold Paint Huffer guy. For those not in the know, the Gold Paint Huffer guy is an minor Internet Celebrity made famous by his unfortunate mug shot (image on the left). He&#8217;s seen staring blankly into the camera in a way that only a true huffer can, his face covered in gold paint, and wearing a creepy scowl reminiscent of an angry stroke victim. The photo is both tragic yet hysterical. </p>
<p>The costume idea popped into my head literally right as I walked by <strike>a party store</strike> Halloween Headquarters on the day of. Five minutes later and two bucks poorer I was the proud new owner of a do-it-yourself Gold Paint Huffer kit: a tube of gold facepaint.  However, later that night I realized my friend <a href="http://www.pownce.com/chadspacey/">Chad Spacey</a> was a much better fit for the look, and he was really into it. At the end of the evening we busted out the camera for an impromptu photo shoot: </p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://thebooberryalarmclock.blogspot.com/2007/05/frightening-dummies.html">The Booberry Alarmclock</a> posted some photos of a ventriloquist doll (it&#8217;s no dummy!), and this reminded me of this public safety tip: <a href="http://www.tikiroom.com/tikicentral/bb/viewtopic.php?topic=6274&#038;forum=6">How to tell if your ventriloquist puppet is evil</a>:
<div class="imgbox alignright"><a href="http://thebooberryalarmclock.blogspot.com/2007/05/frightening-dummies.html"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/willie-talk-no-willie-kill-you.jpg" alt="Willie talk? No. Willie kill you? Yes!" title="Willie talk? No. Willie kill you? Yes!"/></a></div>
<p>1. Make a large, roaring fire. </p>
<p>2. Within earshot of the doll say “Well, I think it’s about time I get rid of this ventriloquist doll … it’s not doing me any good no more”. </p>
<p>3. Pick up the doll and say “I think this will burn up real good in the fire”</p>
<p>4. Walk towards the fire. </p>
<p>5. Make like you’re going to throw the doll into the fire on the count of 3.</p>
<p>At this point, if your doll is evil, you’ll feel a bite on your arm, or a punch, or some other violent reaction. The doll will try to get out of your grasp, and, if successful, will run away, most likely with an evil cackle out of it’s smiling mouth.  Be careful … he’s not fleeing from you; he’s only looking for a place to hide in order to attack you later. </p>
<p>If nothing happens, your doll is probably not evil. You now have 2 choices:  Throw it into the fire anyway, or put it away. </p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> If you do not throw the doll in the fire, it is suggested that you take a knife with you to bed. It’s possible the doll <i>is</i> evil but knew you were testing it, and is waiting for you to go to sleep before attempting to strangle you. </p>

<p>They love us in the UK! Well, at least someone who was charged with finding stuffing for a sidebar in a weekend filler part of a newspaper in the UK found us a little amusing. Big thanks to Mr. Bali Hai of <a href="http://www.mrbalihai.com/goof">Eye of the Goof</a> for both letting us know that we got a mention in this past weekend&#8217;s Guardian, and sending us a copy of the scanned page. </p>
<p>We feel like we could take on all foes, including those who are <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/04/08/mastermind/">well-dressed and gaze vaguely threateningly from behind a shiny table</a>. A bunch of the other blogs who got mentioned are also favorites of ours, making us feel extra-fancy for being included in such a group. Congrats to <a href="http://dusty7s.blogspot.com/">Dusty Sevens</a>, <a href="http://www.mrbalihai.com/goof">Eye of the Goof</a>, <a href="http://www.brandedinthe80s.com/">Branded in the 80s</a>, <a href="http://worldofkane.blogspot.com/">The World of Kane</a> (who is the fellow who scanned the article for us continentally-challenged folks &#8212; thank you!), <a href="http://thebooberryalarmclock.blogspot.com/">The Booberry Alarm Clock</a> and <a href="http://swapatorium.blogspot.com/">Swapatorium</a>.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>This is a two-part post &#8212; I found <a href="http://www.bookofratings.com">a very funny website</a>, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that I must have been living under a rock to have not seen it before now. I also couldn&#8217;t choose just one thing on it to post, so I&#8217;m doing something completely unheard of, and posting <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/04/13/book-of-ratings-state-quarters-part-7/">two things</a>. HA! Enjoy.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://slumbering.lungfish.com/">Lore Sjöberg</a> takes lists of things &#8212; anything from &#8221; Pasta Shapes&#8221; to &#8220;Aspects of Santa Claus&#8221; and rates them on a grading scale. He gives out a lot of Cs and Ds, a few As, and practically no Bs. And he&#8217;s really goddamned funny.</p>
<p>Given our <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/13/how-to-make-a-bindleflop/">penchant</a> for <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/10/hobo-soup/">hobos</a> &#8217;round the old Junkyard Clubhouse, I couldn&#8217;t help but love his rating of Hobo Signs, the chalk symbols hobos used to communicate what they knew about a town to the hobos that might come after them. They&#8217;re a sort of Hobo Fodor&#8217;s. Here&#8217;s a sample of Lore&#8217;s assessment:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/hobo-sign-the-owner-is-not-here.jpg" alt="Hobo sign: the owner is not here" title="Hobo sign: the owner is not here" height=96 width=80 /></div>
<p><b>The Owner Isn&#8217;t Here</b></p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t seem very good. Unless the owner is thoughtful enough to erase the symbol on his way back in, this is about as useful as a symbol meaning &#8220;it&#8217;s six-thirty.&#8221; I suppose you could carefully inscribe it somewhere where it&#8217;s going to get concealed whenever the ower gets home, maybe by putting it in his driveway or writing it in dust on the welcome mat, then spreading some dirt around the walkway so that the owner wipes his feet when he comes home. But that doesn&#8217;t seem like the sort of things that hobos do. When you&#8217;re playing word association, &#8220;hobo&#8221; is rarely followed by &#8220;elaborate plan.&#8221; <b>D-</b>
</p></blockquote>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hukoti-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=0609808524&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=703A19&#038;bc1=FFFFFF&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>Lore&#8217;s three-part series on Hobo Signs can be found <a href="http://www.bookofratings.com/hobosigns.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.bookofratings.com/hobosigns2.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.bookofratings.com/hobosigns3.html">here</a>. You can find all his ratings at, appropriately enough, <a href="http://www.bookofratings.com">Book of Ratings</a>. And of course, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0609808524/103-7055025-7579835?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=hukoti-20&#038;linkCode=xm2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creativeASIN=0609808524">book</a>, if you want to take your ratings reading on the road.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I would like to discuss one of the true classics of the Disney live action canon: <i>Monkeys, Go Home!</i> This 1967 film has it <i>all</i>&#8230; monkeys* &#8212; four of them, and they&#8217;re &lt;dramatic echo&gt;SPACE MONKEYS&lt;/dramatic echo&gt; &#8230; Dean Jones &#8230; &#8217;60s protests &#8230; Love, Frenchy Style &#8230; and as if that weren&#8217;t enough (no, stop! no, really!) &#8230; <i>Maurice! Chevalier!</i> And! The! Title! Ends! In! An! Exclamation! Point! Can you feel the hilarity?! So zany!!!</p>
<p><i>*phew*</i> &#8230; I&#8217;ll take it down a notch or two now, before someone reaches through the screen to throttle me.</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/dean-jones-puts-his-chimps-to-wo.jpg" alt="Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney's &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;" title="Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney's &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;" height=378 width=500 /><br />
Dean Jones puts his chimps to work, in Disney&#8217;s &quot;Monkeys Go Home!&quot;</div>
<p>Alright now, where was I? Oh yes. Monkeys, Go Home. I mean, Monkeys, Go Home!. In this delightful, fun for <strike>the whole family</strike> maybe some of the family film, Dean Jones plays Henry Dussard, an American who has just inherited an olive farm he has never seen, in the south of France. Ooh la la! Being an American, he&#8217;s got some nutty ideas about how to turn this olive farm into a profitable venture &#8212; by hiring chimps instead of people to work the farm. Luckily, he previously was a chimp trainer for NASA, so he&#8217;s got a team of recently-retired space chimps at his disposal. So wacky!</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/in-the-60s-even-the-chimps-wer.jpg" alt="In the '60s, even the chimps were protesting" title="In the '60s, even the chimps were protesting" height=377 width=500 /><br />
In the &#8217;60s, even the chimps were protesting</div>
<p>The little French town doesn&#8217;t like the idea of having to compete against a chimp-run farm, and they mount an underground resistance against Dussard. The chimps strike back by mounting a protest of their own, fighting for their right to work just as humans do. At the same time, a boozy French broad shows up claiming to be Dussard&#8217;s long-lost cousin (and she is truly fabulous, played by Yvonne Constant), staking claim to half of Dussard&#8217;s farm, and threatening Dussard&#8217;s budding relationship with a barely-legal French tartlet, played by Yvette Mimieux. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/maurice-chevalier-with-the-fren.jpg" alt="Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It's a Small World" title="Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It's a Small World" height=377 width=500 /><br />
Maurice Chevalier, with the French corner of It&#8217;s a Small World</div>
<p>And just for good measure, Maurice Chevalier plays the town priest, who shows up now and then to impart some heavily-accented wisdom, and sing a song or two.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hukoti-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B00006675V&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=8F5E11&#038;bc1=FFFFFF&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr&#038;nou=1" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>This is quite possibly the slapstickiest, monkeyest, wacknuttiest of all the Disney films. The hilarity, it ensues. This film&#8230; well, it&#8217;s sort of the Disney version of the Star Wars Holiday Special. I can&#8217;t help but wonder why they&#8217;ve released it on DVD, but I&#8217;m so glad they did. I kind of love it. </p>
<p>Oh! The music! The music is the best part, and I&#8217;m not kidding around here &#8212; I would sincerely buy Robert F. Brunner&#8217;s soundtrack/score. It&#8217;s great &#8217;60s light-quirk-funk-pop stuff.</p>
<p><small>* Technically, chimps aren&#8217;t monkeys, but for the sake of simplicity, today we&#8217;ll say they are. It&#8217;s Topsy-Turvy day! Shrimp are fish! Tomatoes are vegetables! Mama&#8217;s Family was funny!</small></p>

Malarkey? or Effective Way?</a> [Amazon.com]</p>
<p>A thoughtful treatise from Hiroyuki Nishigaki. From the Book Description on Amazon:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think constricting anus 100 times and denting navel 100 times in succession everyday is effective to good-bye depression and take back youth. You can do so at a boring meeting or in a subway. I have known 70-year-old man who has practiced it for 20 years. As a result, he has good complexion and has grown 20 years younger. His eyes sparkle. He is full of vigor, happiness and joy. He has neither complained nor born a grudge under any circumstance. Furthermore, he can make love three times in succession without drawing out.</p>
<p>In addition, he also can have burned a strong beautiful fire within his abdomen. It can burn out the dirty stickiness of his body, release his immaterial fiber or third attention which has been confined to his stickiness. Then, he can shoot out his immaterial fiber or third attention to an object, concentrate on it and attain happy lucky feeling through the success of concentration.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know concentration which gives you peculiar pleasure, your life looks like a hell. </p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t you feel better already?</p>
