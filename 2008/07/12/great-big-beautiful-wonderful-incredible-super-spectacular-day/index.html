<p>Before I traded in my National Geographics for <strike>Playboys</strike> Hustlers, I was a consistent reader of MAD.  What I really loved was the occasional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexi-disc">flexi-disc</a> records they&#8217;d include in their Super Specials. And the holy grail of all flexi-discs was The MAD Mystery Record. The record played &#8220;Super Spectacular Day&#8221;, a story in song that described the most absolute best day you could ever be having &#8212; <i>until</i> &#8212; the record randomly branched into one of eight different disastrous random endings. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s still clever even as an adult, but as a kid I was simply fascinated by it. How could a record have different endings? How did the record choose which one to play? I played the record over and over to hear them all and to study how it worked. Finally my Dad explained it to me: while normal records have one spiral groove per side, the MAD disc had multiple grooves spiraled together in parallel. All of the grooves had music that started off with the same beginning, so the branching appeared to happen mid-way through. But in reality it was the initial drop of the needle that determined what ending played. </p>
<p>Super Spectacular Day is a classic example of MAD&#8217;s corny humor. And of course, someone has put all eight tracks on Youtube so you can enjoy it for free (Cheap!). The actual playback of the song starts about 30 seconds in. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the Lyrics, courtesy of <a href="http://barrygoldberg.net/sillysongs/superspectacular.htm#all">barrygoldberg.net</a>, rearranged to match the order of the Youtube video:  </p>
<p>CHORUS:<br />
It&#8217;s a great big, beautiful, wonderful, incredible, super-spectacular day<br />
And your heart is humming with good times coming<br />
And you got that happy feeling things are going your way<br />
All the bells are ringing and a little bird&#8217;s singing while he sits on your windowsill<br />
Singing yessiree, I can surely see, it will plainly be, most definitely<br />
A super-spectacular day! </p>
<h3>Untilllllllll&#8230;</h3>
<p>#1<br />
&#8216;Round quarter to five your relations arrive<br />
And you greet cousin Beth with terrible breath<br />
And a fat British guy who destroys your hi-fi<br />
And your great uncle Fred who gets drunk in your bed<br />
And your third cousin Dick who is metally sick<br />
And his creepy friend Joe and six more you don&#8217;t know<br />
And you&#8217;re sure there and then as you&#8217;re shafted again&#8230;</p>
<p>#2:<br />
&#8216;Round seven at night you go out for a bite<br />
The streets are aglow from a large UFO<br />
A creature comes out with two heads and a snout<br />
It talks like a frog and throws up on your dog<br />
It thinks you are great and wants you for its mate<br />
You&#8217;re sealed in a case and go flying in space<br />
And you silently say as the Earth fades away&#8230;</p>
<p>#3:<br />
You walk out the door of a dry cleaning store<br />
And you&#8217;re grabbed by surprise by three mafia guys<br />
Who mistakenly think that you&#8217;re Hymie the Fink<br />
They break your right arm and do bodily harm<br />
And you&#8217;re writhing in pain and you try to explain<br />
That your name is Jerome and you&#8217;re on your way home<br />
And you let out a sigh as you&#8217;re left there to die&#8230;</p>
<p>#4:<br />
A quarter past eight you pick up your blind date<br />
And you really go ape for her fabulous shape<br />
Of the girls that you&#8217;ve met she&#8217;s the classiest yet<br />
And she&#8217;s pretty and bright and it&#8217;s love at first sight<br />
And it&#8217;s really a shame she&#8217;s not feeling the same<br />
&#8216;Cuz she thinks you&#8217;re a shmuck and she says &#8220;lots of luck&#8221;<br />
And you sob in despair as she gives you the air&#8230;</p>
<p>#5:<br />
You&#8217;re called down in class and you feel like an ass<br />
&#8216;Cuz you don&#8217;t have a clue and you know that it&#8217;s due<br />
To those classes you skipped and you&#8217;re fly is unzipped<br />
And your acne has spread to the back of your head<br />
And some jerk spreads the word that you&#8217;re some kind of nerd<br />
And you fight in the hall and punch through a wall<br />
And there isn&#8217;t a doubt as they&#8217;re flunking you out&#8230;</p>
<p>#6:<br />
You develop a twitch and a horrible itch<br />
And you&#8217;re covered with spots and you&#8217;re getting the trots<br />
And you&#8217;re feet start to swell and it&#8217;s easy to tell<br />
From this hideous wheeze that some awful disease<br />
So you call an M.D. and he says &#8220;don&#8217;t ask me&#8221;<br />
If it gets any worse you can speak to my nurse<br />
And you manage to say as you wither away&#8230;</p>
<p>#7:<br />
Your sister pours glue in her hair and blames you<br />
And your neighbor says that you&#8217;re abusing her cat<br />
And you just left the john with the water turned on<br />
And the house gets all wet and your mother&#8217;s upset<br />
And you&#8217;d die if you knew what your dad&#8217;s gonna do<br />
And your python gets loose and you know it&#8217;s no use<br />
And you cry there in fear and it&#8217;s now very clear&#8230;</p>
<p>#8:<br />
You go out for a spin and your sunroof caves in<br />
And the steering wheel shakes so you slam on the brakes<br />
And the gears get all stuck as you sideswipe a truck<br />
And you run out of gas while you&#8217;re trying to pass<br />
And you&#8217;re stalled on the tracks and you try to relax<br />
But the train&#8217;s coming through and it&#8217;s heading for you<br />
And you have a quick flash as you brace for the crash&#8230;.</p>
<h3>&#8230; that it’s not such a super-spectacular day!</h3>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>One day my 5 year old said, &#8220;Dad can you sing me a song?&#8221; And so without even thinking, I started out with the first 1/2 of the song, getting all of the lyrics exact, but I never remembered the &#8220;Until&#8221;s very well. Thanks so much for keeping this alive! My 8 year old loves it! His brother can&#8217;t quite understand the &#8220;until&#8221;s, but we&#8217;re having fun with it regardless&#8230;Thanks again!</p>

I really wish I still had this record.  It&#8217;s wild to think about how novel this really was.  And how catchy.  I like the previous quote about the Goodfellas cast.  Much thanks!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>This is absolutely priceless!  Like others, I&#8217;ve had this tune bouncing around my head for 30 years, and could always sing the first half perfectly but couldn&#8217;t remember any of the UNTIL&#8217;s in detail.  In 1990 or 1991, I actually wrote to Mad magazine asking if they had any copies they could send me&#8211;I&#8217;d long since lost mine.  I got a letter from William Gaines himself, saying sorry, it sure was popular, all sold out!</p>

We lost the original, but wouldn&#8217;t be able to play it now anyway. This is my opportunity to enjoy it again and even pass down to the kids.  Something I know they will absolutely luv and enjoy!</p>

I remember being invited to bring records for a church event, and I asked about bringing this one, &#8220;but some of the songs aren&#8217;t good to listen to&#8221; (remembering &#8220;called on in class&#8221;). I couldn&#8217;t get them to understand that I just skipped over that one, and that the rest of it was funny, and acceptable.</p>
