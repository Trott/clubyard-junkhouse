<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/swayze-tattoo.jpg" alt="Swayze tattoo" title="Swayze tattoo" height=500 width=375 /></div>
<p>Why, yes, yes, that is exactly what you think it is. A tattoo on a man&#8217;s calf, of Patrick Swayze as a Chippendale&#8217;s dancer/centaur, on a field of purple haze-sky, with criss-crossed rainbows behind him. </p>
<p>There will never be another tattoo more majestic than this one (Move over <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/07/colonel-sanders-nightmare-tattoo/">Celtic Colonel Sanders tattoo</a>, now there&#8217;s something surrealler). It&#8217;s really too good to be true. I think this picture should be displayed on your television set on Easter morning, a la the Yule Log. Enjoy.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A graffiti artist named Morfai <a href="http://morfai.blogspot.com/2008/09/seeder.html">created this piece</a> on a wall in Kaunas, Lithuania. During the day, it&#8217;s just a random spray of stars on a wall next to a statue of a farmer:</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/puffy-e-t-stickers.jpg" alt="Puffy E.T. stickers" title="Puffy E.T. stickers" height=504 width=288 /><br />
Puffy E.T. stickers</div>
<p>Okay, these cracked up my proverbial shit. Over at <a href="http://ilovethisworld.com/?p=2594">I Love This World</a>, René got these knockoff puffy E.T The Extra Terrestrial stickers for just $2 on eBay. $2! That&#8217;s what I call value. I mean, let&#8217;s take a look at these for a moment:</p>
<p>It all starts off as you might expect, with E.T. bopping merrily along in his glowy spaceship, apparently rocking out to some groovy tuneage on his totally boss headphones (with two antennae!). </p>
<p>Then, we learn that E.T. is a lefty, as he veges out in front of his favorite video game, with his unused right hand to his lips in pensive thought. But he doesn&#8217;t have the look of your standard tensed-up, video game-obsessed teen&#8230; no, his look is almost wistful, as if this game reminds him of a summer spent on the far side of his home planet&#8230; and he&#8217;s inspired to softly whistle a merry tune. I like this softer side of E.T.</p>
<p>Why, here&#8217;s another side of E.T. I like! It&#8217;s Get-Down Disco E.T.! He has got <i>all</i> the moves, and he wants you to come shake it with him! Come on, there&#8217;s a party in E.T.&#8217;s bathroom, and you&#8217;re invited! It&#8217;s BYOBathrobe, baby!</p>
<p>Whew! That&#8217;s quite a sweat we worked up, so now it&#8217;s time to get tidy. E.T. knows that all the good little boys &#038; girls &#038; whatevers need to scrub down, especially under their armpits. </p>
<p>Awwww&#8230; E.T. wants to show you his favorite panda. Hello, E.T.&#8217;s favorite panda! What a lucky panda you are to have such a friend.</p>
<p>HOLY CRAP. I&#8217;m sorry, I did not see this coming. The knockoff puffy sticker people killed E.T.! Or, at least hooked him up to some serious Muppet Labs-caliber equipment, so you know the best case scenario is that his head is going to explode. </p>
<p>Poor E.T. Such a fun-loving guy. Why couldn&#8217;t we just let him be? Why must we humans always kill what we do not understand? Thank you, knockoff puffy stickers, for showing me that sometimes an alien can be the better human. I am changed.</p>
<p>And now, I&#8217;m really, really wishing that I still had my E.T. latchwork pillow kit from when I was 8. Why-oh-why didn&#8217;t I find the wherewithal to finish it? I could be an eBay HUNDREDAIRE!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve been pestered by a few friends, and some strangers (Hi Books Inc!) to post my paper wallets. See, I make these wallets, out of paper, then use them till they almost fall apart, and then make new ones. For over 10 years now. And I&#8217;ve been meaning to post them here when they&#8217;re all shiny and new; before they slowly get dinged up and torn; before they conform to the shape of my ass. But the problem is when I make a new one, I almost always forget to take photos. And when I remember to take photos, I get so picky about the lighting and background and the angles that the photos never get taken. </p>
<p>But in the spirit of getting shit done and moving on, I present to you crappy photos of my previous two paper wallets, taken today, on my desk under the yellow light of my <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/11/30/knex-lamp/">K&#8217;nex lamp</a>, with the bare minimum effort put into setting up the shots.</p>
<p>Today we have two paper wallets. </p>
<h3>60s Legs Paper Wallet</h3>
<p><b>NOTE: At the time these photos were taken, the wallet&#8217;s seen a few months of wear and tear, and is looking a little weathered not unlike an off-the-strip Vegas cocktail waitress (Sorry mom! No offense!), but when it was new it looked fly.</b></p>
<p>This wallet was made out of two extra-long postcards I found in some gift store. I thought legs would make a great theme.  I was wrong. Still I like how it turned out, and it has only offended a few so far. </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet-001.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/boot-wallet-002.jpg" alt="Boot Wallet" title="Boot Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<h3>North Woods Inn Paper Wallet</h3>
<p><b>NOTE: At the time these photos were taken, the wallet was so badly worn that I retired it (and made the Legs wallet above), so it&#8217;s looking a bit like the box to a &#8220;We swear it works fine&#8221; returned digital camera at Fry&#8217;s. When it was new, it looked <i>badass</i>.</b></p>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.clearmansrestaurants.com/northwoods.html">Clearman&#8217;s North Woods Inn</a>.  A lot. It is so fantastic it deserves it&#8217;s own post here. But here&#8217;s the Cliff Notes: The North Woods Inn is a themed family restaurant in Southern California that takes it&#8217;s cue from the rustic romanticism of the snow dusted Klondike.  It&#8217;s a big log cabin (and by big I mean freaking huge) with permanent, fiberglass snow on it&#8217;s rooftop. The place has not changed since it opened in the 60s &#8230; but is has also not fallen into disrepair. It looks pretty much like I imagine it looked like on opening day; preserved in time perhaps better than Disneyland. The food is good, the service is friendly, and the crowd has real appeal &#8212; multiple generations of families gathering to celebrate good report cards and new drivers licenses. I ate lunch there on a Sunday and must have heard Happy Birthday (sung to the real tune of Happy Birthday) and Happy Anniversary (also sung to the real tune of Happy Birthday) at least thirty times. </p>
<p>Anyway, at the gift shop I picked up a couple of North Woods Inn pint glasses, and a set of North Woods Inn steak knives, and of course some of these fancy North Woods Inn postcards, which I used to make perhaps my favoriteist wallet of them all: the North Woods Inn Paper Wallet. </p>
<p>I need to make a new one of these soon.</p>

<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-001.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>Wait! Here&#8217;s some photos I just found when the wallet was pretty new, and I took it back to the motherland to be reunited with cheese toast, their famous &#8220;two salads&#8221;, and a stein of Molson (okay, okay, it was probably Anchor Steam):</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-003.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>And now for the reverse angle: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/north-woods-inn-paper-wallet-004.jpg" alt="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" title="North Woods Inn Paper Wallet" align="center"/></div>
<p>I hope to post more, with better pictures, as I make new ones. And there&#8217;s a whole story about <i>why</i> I started making them in the first place. Watch this space for more!</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/ceramic-rooster-001.jpg" alt="Ceramic Rooster" title="Ceramic Rooster" height=365 width=250 /></div>
<p>There are many things in life that are not for me to understand, and chief among them is the ubiquitous ceramic kitchen rooster. It&#8217;s one of those things that for many years I didn&#8217;t even think to question, but once I did set to wondering, I became amazed and mystified by this seemingly-simple kitchen tchotchke.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve seen these a hundred times before, and I&#8217;d wager you haven&#8217;t given them a lot of thought, either. But, they&#8217;re kind of weird. For starters, the rooster is always depicted with all the noble bearing of a Roman general. These roosters don&#8217;t look like they&#8217;re just the big man around the henhouse, they look like they&#8217;ve <i>just come back from conquering half of Europe</i>. And they&#8217;re not cheap &#8212; the one pictured here has a $375 price tag. Who is spending nearly four hundred dollars on a ceramic chicken? Granted, it&#8217;s a very, very nice ceramic chicken, but it seems a bit odd that this would be happening all the time without a few questions being asked.</p>
<p>Questions like &#8230; who makes these? Somewhere out there, someone is making a living off of making ceramic roosters. Someone is a ceramic rooster <i>artisan</i>. Someone learned how to make ceramic roosters from their grandfather, and comes from a long line of rooster-makers. Perhaps there is a village in Italy that is renowned for its collection of fine chicken portaitists.</p>
<p>When I first started to ponder the kitchen rooster a few years ago, I started photographing them whenever I saw one. I finally gave up after I hit a few dozen &#8212; the suckers are all over the place. But here&#8217;s the kicker &#8212; I never saw two that were alike. They have <i>got</i> to be made from molds, but why have I not seen any duplicate chickens? The variety in the ceramic rooster market is simply astounding.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers, and frankly, I don&#8217;t want them &#8212; I like a little mystery now &#038; then. So, the next time to cross the path of a very fancy ceramic kitchen rooster, ponder for a moment where he came from, and where he&#8217;s headed. And be thankful you aren&#8217;t a peasant in some tiny European village he&#8217;s just ransacked.</p>
<p><small>p.s. &#8212; I do appreciate the irony in this questioning of ceramic roosters coming from a woman who runs a <a href=http://www.ooga-mooga.com>huge site dedicated to ceramic drinking cups made to look like Polynesian gods</a>.</small></p>

Miniature Fabergé Chair, sold by Sotheby&#8217;s</div>
<p>Last night in a fit of sleeplessness, I came across this chair, which was just sold under auction at Sotheby&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just a smidge over 2&#8243; tall. It was created by Fabergé sometime between 1899 and 1903. I think it&#8217;s just stunning. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070418/ap_on_re_us/miniature_chair_auction_1;_ylt=Ar8PRwb6ErUwJi8lUWTO1qnBaMYA">2.8 million dollars worth of stunning</a> (that&#8217;s what it sold for), but I do find myself utterly enchanted by it. I&#8217;ve always been on the wee side myself, which I think makes me a bit drawn to all things undersized. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s the work of Fabergé workmaster Michael Perchin, and is based on furniture designed in 1839 by Leo von Klenze for Tsar Nicholas I for the new Hermitage in St. Petersburg. It&#8217;s crafted out of gold and enamel, with the surfaces ground to resemble the grain in mahogany. The front is a removable drawer. Miniature furniture by Fabergé is very rare; other similar pieces, including a miniature table and desk, are in the collection of Queen Elisabeth II.</p>
<p>It got me started looking through the famous eggs that Fabergé made for Russia&#8217;s royal Romanov family from 1885, right up until everything went kerplooie for them in 1917. I thought that I&#8217;d looked through the Fabergé eggs before, but it turns out I hadn&#8217;t &#8212; I recognized a few of them, but I definitely hadn&#8217;t seen all of them, and didn&#8217;t know exactly how intricate some of them were. I always thought of them as little boxes, but I had no idea the wide variety and creativity in their construction. For instance, I wasn&#8217;t aware that some of them had clockworks, and even automotons &#8212; chirping, wing-flapping birds! </p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/peter-the-great-faberge-egg.jpg" alt="Peter the Great Fabergé egg" title="Peter the Great Fabergé egg" height=384 width=300 /><br />
Peter the Great Fabergé egg</div>
<p>The history of the eggs is very interesting, particularly seeing them in the context of what was happening in the Romanov family through the years, how World War I impacted everything, and of course the whole Rasputin brouhaha. After the Bolsheviks took over, the eggs sort of scattered to the four winds, and some of them are still missing, or have parts missing. The ultimate Easter egg hunt, I suppose.</p>
<p>The eggs are the very definition of ornate, and at first glance are just too much. However, these haven&#8217;t been executed by clumsy hands &#8212; no Bedazzler atrocities here &#8212; every detail is so finely crafted, so mind-bogglingly precise, it&#8217;s hard not to get sucked in. Find some pictures that let you really zoom in on the detail &#8212; it&#8217;s breathtaking. No really &#8212; I found myself holding my breath even just looking at them on a computer screen, I&#8217;d probably seize right up if I ever got to see one in person. I can&#8217;t think of anything else that I&#8217;ve ever seen that has so much care and fine detail in such a compact space, just for art&#8217;s sake. Nobody is making things like this anymore, and that&#8217;s a shame. </p>
<p>The Fabergé eggs have been documented pretty well on the <a href="http://www.mieks.com/Faberge2/index2.htm">Mieks site</a>, including lots of great up-close photographs from different angles, and even some video (the video of the Clover-leaf egg in particular makes a big difference &#8212; photos can&#8217;t capture how delicate and translucent the egg is).</p>

He&#8217;s done some very large installations that are impressive, but by far my favorite pieces are his simple works done out of a single page of standard A4 paper (A4 is the most common size of paper outside of North America; our 8½x11&#8243; sheets are an anomaly).</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/half-way-through-by-peter-calle.jpg" alt="Half Way Through, by Peter Callesen" title="Half Way Through, by Peter Callesen" height=356 width=499 /><br />
Half Way Through, by Peter Callesen</div>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/detail-of-skeleton.jpg" alt="Detail of skeleton" title="Detail of skeleton" height=264 width=250 /></div>
<p>Callesen cuts shapes partway out of the paper, and folds them into objects that remain attached to the paper. The hole where the paper was removed remains as a sort of shadow, or as its own element in the piece. </p>
<p>In <i>Down the River</i>, a wall of water cascades off the edge of the paper, and a tiny canoe with two paddlers is headed for it. In <i>Angel</i>, the removed paper leaves a shadow of a tiny angel, surrounded by beams of light; the paper that was cut out has been formed into a cage whre the angel now sits &#8212; and the paper appears to have never been removed from the A4 sheet. <i>Closet</i> has a full 3-D wardrobe, with monsters crammed into it; the shadow left behind in the paper sheet shows a creepy menagerie and hints at the contents of the closet.</p>
<p>Callesen&#8217;s website has dozens of truly inventive pieces &#8212; some are astounding in their intricacies and elaborate forms, while others are simple and clever, and all the more compelling for it. Below is the one I think is the most stunning, in terms of its beauty:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/cradle-by-peter-callesen.jpg" alt="Cradle, by Peter Callesen" title="Cradle, by Peter Callesen" height=315 width=500 /><br />
Cradle, by Peter Callesen</div>
<p>There are so many fantastic pieces at Peter Callesen&#8217;s website that I wish I could put them all here &#8212; instead, I&#8217;m going to insist that you go over to Callesen&#8217;s website and see them for yourself. Here is <a href="http://www.petercallesen.com">Peter Callesen&#8217;s website</a>, and here is a link directly to <a href="http://www.petercallesen.com/index/A4PAPERCUT_000.htm">his A4 pieces</a>.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, the other day, I became temporarily obsessed with these little plastic nuggets:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/just-one-word-plastics.jpg" alt="Just one word. Plastics." title="Just one word. Plastics." height=305 width=500 /><br />
Just one word. Plastics.</div>
<p>I have fond childhood memories of filling up little metal frames with these plastic bits and melting them in the oven to make stained-glass suncatchers. But for the life of me, I couldn&#8217;t remember what the heck they were called. A lot of Googling time only brought up a company that makes <a href="http://www.judaism.com/search.asp?itemtype=&#038;nt=DH&#038;keyword=stained+glass+kit">Jewish-themed ones</a>, and I&#8217;m pretty sure I wasn&#8217;t making stained-glass dreidels and menorahs when I was a kid. It was more like mushrooms and butterflies and frogs &#8212; y&#8217;know, good &#8217;70s stuff. Just when I was ready to give up, I found &#8216;em &#8212; they&#8217;re <a href="http://colorbok.com/DeptFiles/mandb.aspx?PageType=2&#038;RecordID=385">Makit &#038; Bakits</a>. And they&#8217;re still making them! </p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/kindergarten-level-glazier.jpg" alt="Kindergarten-level glazier" title="Kindergarten-level glazier" height=261 width=200 /><br />
Kindergarten-level glazier</div>
<p>Well, that meant a jaunt to my friendly neighborhood craft store was in order. Sure enough, there was a very small selection of kits. They even make glow-in-the-dark ones now. I had to buy one. I picked out this little flower one, just because the colors were more interesting than the ones in the other sets. It rang up at $1.35 (!). It was definitely at least $2, maybe even $3, worth of fun. That&#8217;s value, my friends. </p>
<p>I cheated and mixed the colors on the petals, because I like it when the nuggets blend together like that. I&#8217;m happy enough with how it turned out, but I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m going to do with it; it will probably live a prostrate and nomadic life, moving about the house from one flat surface to another along with random scraps of papers and other doodads, until I throw it out.</p>
<p>So, now what? Here&#8217;s what &#8212; I&#8217;ve got a whole mess of those little plastic nuggets left. They seem to have designed these kits to come with enough pellets to recover from a spill onto the particle abyss that was a &#8217;70s shag carpet. I think I might actually somehow have more of these plastic bits than I started with. It&#8217;s the melting of the plastic bits that&#8217;s the most fun with these &#8212; the frames are kind of ass &#8212; so I can&#8217;t just throw these out, I&#8217;ve got to melt them. But how? In what shape?</p>
<p>My current thinking is that I want to lay them out in a disc shape and melt them, and then, while they&#8217;re still warm, shape them into a little bowl. Kind of like they do on television cooking shows with grated parmesan. But I can&#8217;t help but think that this is worth pondering a little bit more.</p>
<p>Got any ideas?</p>

There&#8217;s no name attached to the blog, but if it is who I think it is, then his one-two punch of excellent photography skills matched with uncanny thrifting ability should combine into a really swell blog.</p>

Bedknobs and Broomsticks</div>
<p>I think these fish are great; they often have really great shaded paint jobs that make them look almost like sugar candy or marzipan. Their happy and alluring demeanor always reminds me of the underwater sequence in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R9A4/103-7055025-7579835?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=hukoti-20&#038;linkCode=xm2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creativeASIN=B00004R9A4">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a>. </p>

<p> The great Disney blog <a href="http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-character-ranger-j-audubon.html">2719 Hyperion</a> has a wonderful post about one of my favorite overlooked Disney characters J. Audubon Woodlore, the park ranger. I fell in love with him as a kid when I saw the classic &#8220;In The Bag&#8221;, where he makes up a little song and dance to convince the bears to clean up the park. Apparently In The Bag was such a hit that it inspired a record called the &#8220;Humphrey Hop.&#8221; </p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;tag=tikiroomcom&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=tg/detail/-/B000ATQYUG"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/disney-rarities.jpg" width=86 height=117 alt="Disney Rarities" title="Disney Rarities"/></a></div>
<p>The short is available on a Disney DVD called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&#038;camp=1789&#038;tag=tikiroomcom&#038;creative=9325&#038;path=tg/detail/-/B000ATQYUG">Disney Rarities</a>. Check out <a href="http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2007/03/what-character-ranger-j-audubon.html">2719 Hyperion&#8217;s overview</a> of this great oft-forgotten Disney character.<br />
UPDATE:  I need to remember to search Youtube before making any post. In The Bag is on Youtube right now. I&#8217;m not sure how long it will be on there, but for now, enjoy!<br />
