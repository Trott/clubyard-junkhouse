<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/here-comes-peter-cottontail.jpg" alt="Here Comes Peter Cottontail" title="Here Comes Peter Cottontail" height=357 width=250 /><br />
Here Comes Peter Cottontail</div>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hukoti-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B00005UM20&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=8B4F0F&#038;bc1=FFFFFF&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr&#038;nou=1" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;Here Comes Peter Cottontail&#8221; since I was a kid. I don&#8217;t remember it very well, but it&#8217;s probably the better of the two, and I&#8217;m really eager to see it again. It&#8217;s available on DVD, and I&#8217;m going to try to get it before Easter. </p>
<p>Watch out: there&#8217;s an utterly despicable 2005 sequel called &#8220;Here Comes Peter Cottontail: The Movie.&#8221; About 20 minutes into trying to watch it, I developed Tourette&#8217;s. If you&#8217;ve seen the 2001 sequel to Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, &#8220;Rudolph and the Island of Misfit Toys,&#8221; then you have an idea of how bad the Peter Cottontail sequel is. If you haven&#8217;t heard of either of them, just do whatever you can to steer clear of them.<br clear=both /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/images/the-easter-bunny-is-comin-to-to.jpg" alt="The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town" title="The Easter Bunny Is Comin' to Town" height=300 width=162 /><br />
The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#8217; to Town</div>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><iframe src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=hukoti-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=B000BVM1T6&#038;fc1=000000&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=764010&#038;bc1=FFFFFF&#038;bg1=FFFFFF&#038;f=ifr&#038;nou=1" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;The Easter Bunny Is Comin&#8217; to Town&#8221; is a whole &#8216;nother egg hunt&#8230; and it&#8217;s actually just a re-tread of &#8220;Santa Claus Is Comin&#8217; to Town.&#8221; Just as the Santa Claus in that special bears little resemblance to the Santa seen in the Rudolph special, this tale has nothing in common with the Peter Cottontail special &#8212; the protaganist here is Sunny the Bunny. </p>
<p>In both &#8220;Comin&#8217; to Town&#8221;s: the narrator is a postman played by Fred Astaire; the holiday icon (Sunny in &#8220;Easter Bunny&#8221;, Kris Kringle in &#8220;Santa Claus&#8221;) lives in one town, and wants to deliver their holiday gifts to children in another town; delivery of the gifts is thwarted by the authority figure in the town, and sneaky ways to get the gifts delivered in the dark of night are developed; and along the way, today&#8217;s well-known traditions are spawned. Oh &#8212; and both figures also have trouble getting over a mountain between the two towns, because of a big scary monster type of obstruction that by the end of the special has learned to be good. It&#8217;s like they just took one script and filled it in Mad Libs-style to get two specials out of it. </p>
<p>Despite the strange deja vu feeling of watching &#8220;Easter Bunny,&#8221; it&#8217;s not half bad. The thing that bugs me is that the jelly beans look more like jelly noodles. It&#8217;s kind of weird.</p>

<p><i>The Leprechauns&#8217; Christmas Gold</i> is &#8212; and I say this as a massive Rankin/Bass fan &#8212; a disappointment. First off, why on earth didn&#8217;t Rankin/Bass make this as a St. Patrick&#8217;s Day special? Heck, even Groundhog Day got a Rankin/Bass special, but instead they chose to further glut their already overloaded Christmas special catalog with this. Leprechauns belong to St. Patrick&#8217;s Day, period. Rankin/Bass had a bad history of cross-polluting their holidays (see: <i>Rudolph &#038; Frosty&#8217;s Christmas in July</i>, <i>Rudolph&#8217;s Shiny New Year</i>). But this is just a straight out <i>omission</i>. Okay, okay, it&#8217;s got the song &#8220;Christmas in Kilarney,&#8221; which nearly sells me on the concept&#8230; but really it&#8217;s a stretch.</p>
<p>Despite that, with all its over-the-top stereotypical Irish-like goodness, it&#8217;s Rankin/Bass&#8217; sort-of St. Patrick&#8217;s Day special. If you squint. And turn the volume down. [<i>and drink! -Hanford</i>] It stars Art Carney as the leprechaun Blarney Kilakilarney, whose clan lives on a remote, fog-cloaked island uninhabited by humans. They share the island with a competing leprechaun clan, including his ex-wife. Along comes a boy looking for a Christmas tree, he takes the one on the island, which was really a trap for the banshee, who&#8217;s now on the loose, and wants the leprechauns&#8217; gold, blah blah blah, she&#8217;s after me pot o&#8217; gold!, blah blah blah, the end. Unless you&#8217;re a Rankin/Bass diehard, go watch <a href="http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/2007/03/09/its-the-banshee/">Darby O&#8217;Gill and the Little People</a> instead.</p>
<p>But, all this talk of &#8220;you&#8217;re just after me pot o&#8217; gold!&#8221; gives me an excuse to post a link to <a href="http://goldpaint.ytmnd.com">this</a>. Which only makes sense if you have your speakers on. And even then, not really. It just makes me giggle.</p>
<p>Happy St. Patrick&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>The image on the left is from a rare stop-motion puppet of Jerry Lewis that was built by the Rankin/Bass animation studio for some specials. While I&#8217;m not a huge Jerry Lewis fan, I can&#8217;t get over how cool it would have been if Rankin/Bass (creators of <i>all</i> the great stop-motion Christmas specials) had gone through and produced these cartoons. The puppet has a look to it that you just don&#8217;t see in modern animation. Check out the <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/7601/3362/1600/460660/JERRY%20LEWIS.jpg">all the photos of the Jerry Lewis Puppet</a>.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2007/02/un-produced-jerry-lewis-rankinbass.html">Rankin/Bass Historian</a>, it turns out that Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass were huge Jerry Lewis fans and were working on two projects to being Jerry Lewis to stop-motion world. One was &#8220;Punch and Judy&#8221; and the other was &#8220;The Bellboy&#8221;. They never went into full production but there <i>was</i> some work done on them. A song was written called &#8220;Hey Bellhop!&#8221;, which has been locked away in the Rankin/Bass vaults all these years. A demo recording of the song will be included in the soon-to-be-released soundtrack to the <a href="http://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2007/01/daydreamer-soundtrack-cd.html">The Daydreamer</a>, a special I&#8217;ve never seen.  Seeing the image of the Jerry Lewis puppet fills my mind with thoughts of what this might have been. </p>
