            <div class="entry">
                <p>JYC EXCLUSIVE: Yesterday Humu and I were strolling down the frozen dessert aisle of Whole Foods when we both spotted a new Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s flavor: Banana Split. We noticed immediately how the logo on the ice cream container was a spot-on copy of the Hanna-Barbera <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_splits">Banana Splits</a> band logo, minus the last S in the word &#8220;Splits&#8221;. Just compare the Banana Split package to the cover of the Banana Splits album I have: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splits-logo.jpg" alt="Banana Splits logo" title="Banana Splits logo"/><br />Ben and Jerry&#8217;s ice cream on the left; Album from the 1960s band Banana Splits on the right</div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closeup of both logos: </p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/banana-splits-logo-closeup.jpg" alt="Banana Splits logo closeup" title="Banana Splits logo closeup"/></div>
<p>Since Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s are (A) known for exploiting the nostalgia of the 60s to sell ice cream, and (B) unforgiving in their endless barrage of shameless product tie-ins, I wouldn&#8217;t put it past them to license the classic bubble-gum band to shill for them. I&#8217;m sure the Splits would do it. </p>
<p>I picked up the carton and scanned the entire package to see if there was any credit or trademark assignment to Hanna-Barbera, who signed the Banana Splits supergroup to their label and gave them a show back in the 1970s. I <i>did</i> find a copyright notice for the cow illustration that appears on the back of the carton, but I found nothing to indicate that Ben and Jerry&#8217;s had licensed the Banana Splits logo. </p>
<p>Is is possible that Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s is the most recent company to pull a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Goldman">Todd Goldman</a> and appropriate someone else&#8217;s art to pass off as their own? I contacted Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s to find out more, but I have not heard back from them yet. So I decided to go straight to the source and talk to the Banana Splits themselves. </p>
<h3>Not The First Time</h3>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/bingo-from-the-banana-splits.jpg" alt="Bingo from the Banana Splits" title="Bingo from the Banana Splits"/></div>
<p>I got in touch Bingo, the enigmatic second-banana of the Banana Splits (although most music scholars agree he was the &#8220;John Lennon&#8221; of the group), for his comments. Perhaps not surprisingly, he was unaware of the situation. Like most bands from the 70s, the Splits signed over all of their rights to their record label in exchange for fame and fortune, and lost control of their image. </p>
<p>&#8220;We have no say any more, and Hanna-Barbera doesn&#8217;t really care about us. They cater to your every whim if you can make them some coin, but once the money stops coming in, they forget about you! It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re <i>off the bus</i>&#8221; Bingo commented. &#8220;And so they just let golden opportunities like this slip past them. This is not the first time it has happened. We&#8217;ve been trying for years to get royalties from Bob Marley&#8217;s estate, who lifted the chorus melody of <i>Buffalo Soldier</i> directly from our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbU5CzPi0zM">theme song</a>. But Hanna-Barbera just hasn&#8217;t bothered. They don&#8217;t realize the gold mine they&#8217;re sitting on&#8221;  Bingo lamented. He then hit me in the face with a pie. </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the verdict? Well, the jury is still out on this one, so stick with us here at JYC for full scoop (har har) as this story unfolds. If I see that Ben &#038; Jerry&#8217;s is planning a <a href="http://www.wingnuttoons.com/Banana_Conf.html">Sour Grape</a> flavor, you will be the first to know. </p>

Walt Disney&#8217;s passport</div>
<p>Walt Disney&#8217;s 1965 passport is <a href="http://cgi.liveauctions.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;viewitem=&#038;item=170096789923">up for sale on eBay</a>. He died just a year and a half after it was issued, and its only use was for a trip to London. The UK premiere of Mary Poppins was on August 23, 1965, just four days after this passport was issued, and that seems a likely use, but the London arrival stamp isn&#8217;t shown, and the New York return stamp says September 29. It&#8217;s currently at $3,600, and is estimated to close in the neighborhood of $14,400-$21,600 when the auction ends on Saturday.

                <p>Sometimes, your gamble in the candy aisle of a Chinese market pays off&#8230; sometimes it doesn&#8217;t. Not everybody loves haw flakes, but I&#8217;m a fan. </p>

water and red dye.<br />
But mostly haw.</div>
<p>What are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haw_flakes">haw flakes</a>, you ask? Why, they&#8217;re flakes. Made out of haw. Just like it says on the package. They may look like firecrackers, but they&#8217;re a delightful candy treat. Each roll has a couple dozen super-thin wafers of hawiness. They look like monochrome Necco wafers, and taste and feel somewhat like a desiccated Fruit Roll-Up. I think they are delicious, but a few people have said they &#8220;taste like ass.&#8221; Most people seem to like them, though. Even if you don&#8217;t go for the taste, the packaging is so colorful and fun, they&#8217;re hard to resist. Unless you&#8217;re just really disappointed that they aren&#8217;t really firecrackers.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="../../../../images/haw-flakes-in-the-buff.jpg" alt="Haw flakes, in the buff" title="Haw flakes, in the buff" height=277 width=200 /><br />
Haw flakes, in the buff</div>
<p>They are dirt cheap &#8212; possibly literally. I used to work for a dirt company, and dirt can get pretty pricey. As I said, each roll comes with a couple dozen wafers, and ten of those rolls come in a pack. I bought a bag of about a half-dozen packs for just a couple bucks. That&#8217;s somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,400 flakes. I don&#8217;t understand how that is possible, what with all the elaborate packaging involved, and the shipping halfway across the globe. I would love to see pictures of a haw flake factory, they&#8217;re probably lots of fun to watch in action.</p>
<p>I brought some with me to <a href="http://www.forbiddenislandalameda.com">Forbidden Island</a> last week (that&#8217;s our favorite bar, we tend to be there on Wednesdays), and they were a big hit. I might try crumbling some up into some Schnapps of some sort, and call it Hawschläger.</p>

Pee&amp;Poo tattoos</div>
<p>Decades of forward-thinking Scandinavian design have finally reached their pinnacle in this: <a href="http://www.peeandpoo.com">Pee&#038;Poo</a>. Called Kiss&#038;Bajs in their native Swedish, these lil&#8217; darlins of the toilet world are the creation of Emma Megitt. There&#8217;s a whole line of products, including plush toys, keychains, underpants, socks (?) and t-shirts, for both kids and adults. Strangely, no potty training books &#8212; I guess this is just Pee&#038;Poo for pee &#038; poo&#8217;s sake, which I can kind of understand. </p>
<p>The strangest product has to be this set of traditional sailor-style Pee&#038;Poo Tattoos, with skulls and crossbones (in the shape of a deceased Pee and Poo), anchors, and toilet paper banners. My favorite thing about Pee&#038;Poo, though, is their Pee&#038;Poo rainbow. I want one painted on the wall of my bathroom, with the end landing right on the terlet.</p>

                <p>In <a href="/2007/03/29/you-can-be-bobby-darin-and-ill-be-sandra-dee/index.html">a comment on the Bobby Darin post</a>, I was prompted by the always-on-it-like-a-bonnet <a href="http://www.mrbalihai.com/goof/">Mr. Bali Hai</a> to ask my friend <a href="http://www.jimcherry.com">Jim Cherry</a> about his cars-of-the-future book project, <a href="http://www.cartopia.us">Cartopia</a>. </p>

<p>A funny coincidence &#8212; it just so happens that Jim Cherry met with Taschen this afternoon to sign the deal for the book. It turned out the agreement paperwork needed a little work, so it&#8217;s not actually a signed deal yet, but it&#8217;s &#8220;definitely on.&#8221; Taschen has turned out some real beauts over the years, so it&#8217;s great to see them taking this one on. They want Jim to expand the book to include futuristic prototype cars from throughout the 20th century, so it&#8217;s going to be an even bigger book than he thought, and he gets to make some field trips to Detroit to hit the manufacturers&#8217; archives. No word yet on a release date, but a rough draft is scheduled to be done by August, so maybe early 2008? Congratulations, Jim!</p>
<p>To tide you over until Cartopia the book arrives, spend some time at <a href="http://www.cartopia.us">Cartopia the website</a> &#8212; there&#8217;s a trunkload of great midcentury images of futuristic cars, including advertisements, magazine covers and even toy models.</p>

            <div class="entry">
                <p>I adore some of the signage used on apartment buildings during the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s. Here are some great signs I saw just today in Mountain View, CA:</p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/the-elena-apartments-001.jpg" alt="The Elena Apartments" title="The Elena Apartments" height=227 width=300 /></div>
<p>I was doing a lot of &#8220;this one&#8217;s my favorite! no, wait, this one&#8217;s my favorite! oh, wait, <i>this</i> one&#8230;.&#8221; etc, etc today&#8230; but this one might really be my favorite. Today. Of the ones on that block. On that side of the street. I think. No matter &#8212; it&#8217;s clearly fantastic. It was also one of the better-maintained buildings, and looked fresh as a daisy. The lettering is just gorgeous &#8212; I especially love the combination of the scripty &#8220;Elena&#8221; with the staid &#8220;the&#8221; and &#8220;apts&#8221;. Tres elegant. But of course the real standout here are those lovely poodle bushes. I do so love poodle bushes.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/king-apartments.jpg" alt="King apartments" title="King apartments" height=208 width=300 /></div>
<p>I love it when the lettering is really and truly unique. I think that great big fat pancake of a dot hovering over the &#8220;i&#8221; is great, and I really like the added touch of the flag-points at the end of the letters. Very regal.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/casa-del-rey-apartments.jpg" alt="Casa del Rey apartments" title="Casa del Rey apartments" height=198 width=300 /></div>
<p>The lettering on this one is relatively common &#8212; don&#8217;t get me wrong, it&#8217;s gorgeous, and head &#038; shoulders over dull modern signage. But I really grabbed this picture because I love the dramatic entryway, and that beautiful scrollwork globe light fixture. The whole look together is <i>very</i> fancy.<br clear=left /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/sharron-apartments.jpg" alt="Sharron apartments" title="Sharron apartments" height=130 width=300 /></div>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="../../../../images/sharron-apartments-exterior.jpg" alt="Sharron apartments exterior" title="Sharron apartments exterior" height=62 width=200 /></div>
<p>This one gets a B+ on the sign, and a C- on the building &#8212; I&#8217;ve seen military installations that were more inviting. Maybe it&#8217;s nicer once you&#8217;re past the fort-like exterior.<br clear=both /></p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/el-portal-apartments.jpg" alt="El Portal apartments" title="El Portal apartments" height=363 width=300 /></div>
<p>This is my other favorite of today&#8217;s apartments. Spanish-inspired architecture is still novel and exotic for me, and probably always will be &#8212; you don&#8217;t see a lot of it in Seattle. You can&#8217;t see the detail on those doors, but you can probably imagine it, and those light fixtures! Oh, I am a sucker for amber glass and ironwork. This is the kind of place I can see myself living in; it&#8217;s the kind of place I think of when I think of California. And I adore California. Completely.<br clear=left /><br />
If you&#8217;d like to see more and bigger pictures of these buildings, I&#8217;ve got a whole mess of them up at <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/aptsmar07/">Humuhumu&#8217;s Life in Photos</a>.</p>

Dale Sizer pretends he&#8217;s Bobby</div>
<p>My friend <a href="http://www.jimcherry.com">Jim Cherry</a> just went on a tour of Bobby Darin&#8217;s midcentury Hollywood Hills home, and he wrote up the <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&#038;friendID=1111868&#038;blogID=246884918&#038;MyToken=3b078fdb-4540-45f9-a90e-4b1d3a2869b1">tour with photos</a> in a recent blog post on his MySpace. Dale Sizer, who happened to be mentioned in <a href="/2007/03/29/bobbing-along-on-the-bottom-of-the-beautiful-briny-sea/index.html">my post earlier today</a>, was also there to check out the digs.</p>
<p>The house is at 1411 Rising Glen Road, and has 5 bedrooms, 3.5 baths. Jim reports that it&#8217;s relatively un-mucked with. It&#8217;s being offered for just shy of 3.7M. Here&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.1411risingglen.com/">property&#8217;s website</a>, with a full photo tour.</p>

Vintage plaster fish, from Bowling Trophy</div>
<p>These are just some of the lovely <a href="http://bowlingtrophy.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/thrift-item-of-the-moment/">vintage plaster wall fish</a> that have been posted on the new blog, <a href="http://bowlingtrophy.wordpress.com/">Bowling Trophy</a>. There&#8217;s no name attached to the blog, but if it is who I think it is, then his one-two punch of excellent photography skills matched with uncanny thrifting ability should combine into a really swell blog.</p>

Bedknobs and Broomsticks</div>
<p>I think these fish are great; they often have really great shaded paint jobs that make them look almost like sugar candy or marzipan. Their happy and alluring demeanor always reminds me of the underwater sequence in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R9A4/103-7055025-7579835?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=hukoti-20&#038;linkCode=xm2&#038;camp=1789&#038;creativeASIN=B00004R9A4">Bedknobs and Broomsticks</a>. </p>

<p>My friend Dale Sizer did <a href="http://www.timbiskup.com/NewPages/lot10.html">this cool painting of plaster wall fish</a> on a slice of a log a few years ago.</p>

                <p>Okay JYC readers, are you awake?  I&#8217;m going to post these nifty icons, and then <i>you</i> tell us what they are. Not just where they&#8217;re from, but let us know what each icon actually represents. After they&#8217;ve all been guessed (or if too much time passes by) I&#8217;ll post more about this fantastic set. Post your guesses in the comments.  </p>
