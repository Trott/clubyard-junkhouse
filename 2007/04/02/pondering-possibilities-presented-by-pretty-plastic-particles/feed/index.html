		<description><![CDATA[I was just looking for something along this line. My thought was using them in wood turning bowls. Cut a grove in a wood bowl fill it with the bits CA glue them it sand them down to a high gloss and bingo. I seen this done with rock chips and it is a lot harder to sand flat. How big is one bit? my guess is 1/8&quot; Dia. X 3/16&quot; long.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you, thank you, thank you for naming this craft!  You saved me from hours of Google search.  My daughter was gifted with one of these and we lost the directions.  My suggestion for your plastic bits is to use an old canning jar lid (the band, not the actual lid) as your frame.  Might do that myself with our leftovers!  :)]]></description>
