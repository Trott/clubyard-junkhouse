		<description><![CDATA[The funny thing is that they say that it is good for your hands, but apparently not so nice to other parts of the body.  My wife&#039;s ex-husband once used Palmolive as a body wash since he didn&#039;t have any soap and didn&#039;t think to check under her sink for any of the myriad soaps that she had.  He burned his...um...well, sack with that stuff.  So, let that be a lesson to all those people out there who might think, &quot;If it is good for my hands, It must be phenomenal for the rest of my body.&quot;]]></description>
