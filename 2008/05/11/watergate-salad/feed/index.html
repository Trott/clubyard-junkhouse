		<description><![CDATA[I would love to address by name, but I see you&#039;ve created a psuedonymn. Hmm? There is something to be said about the phrase, &quot;If you cannot say anything nice, don&#039;t say it at all.&quot;  Shame on you if you really feel better about bashing not only the recipe, but the dear ladies that publish and make it for gatherings.  Is this blog simply for you to exercise your food snobbery?   If you love food, you do understand that everyone has their own taste and not one is right or wrong, it is simply what it is.  You may not prefer someone else&#039;s favorites, and they may not prefer yours.  Food is one thing that is wonderful in the varieties of flavors as well as what it does to bring people together. Who am I to judge why someone prefers fluff over fouf. That&#039;s one thing about the Midwest that I love-- unless you live in the Chicago-land area, if you&#039;re from the Midwest, you don&#039;t judge others, you just sit back and enjoy each other&#039;s food and company.  Chew on that =) !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[a friend made a variation of this for a potluck at work but she called it a &quot;dump salad&quot;. you dump 1 large can of crushed pineapple, 1 large box of lime jello, 1 large container of cottage cheese, 1 cup of walnunt pieces, 1 package of mini-marshmallows, mix it all up then fold in a large container of whipped cream. i have since made it several times (also in double batches) and it always disappears! i believe people like it because it doesn&#039;t sit as heavy as cake. 
i am looking for the pink one that has cherries, pineapple, whipped cream... etc]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I doubt the flavors were ever actually made, but as a kid I remember a contest in Dynamite Magazine to name a new topical Baskin-Robbins ice cream flavor.  The front runners were &quot;Watergate Ice&quot; (I have no idea what that might taste like), and my favorite, &quot;Impeachmint.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hoo boy, if the packaging on my marshmallows mentioned flavoring, then I missed it in all the excitement. That can&#039;t have helped. The Lutheran cookbook version called for &quot;whipping cream&quot; but I think they meant whipped cream, because it&#039;d be seriously gloopy if it wasn&#039;t whipped. I do, though, think it&#039;d be better with whipped cream than Cool Whip -- one less chemical in the mix.

I do think it&#039;s worth trying again, but I&#039;m going to hang up my Watergate Salad-making hat, and instead look forward to enjoying it from the hands of a master during my next visit to the Rongo Rongo Room. :)

I totally agree about scratch cooking. I was talking to someone just this weekend about how different very old cookbooks are: they assume you know how to do basic things like making a roux. My foray through the 1979 Marysville United Methodist Women&#039;s Cookbook was inspired by a much more noble cooking blog adventure: Trott&#039;s trip through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.palacefamilysteakhouse.com/labels/joy%20of%20cooking.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;entire Joy of Cooking&lt;/a&gt;. I won&#039;t learn how to make a roux, but boy howdy I will be a Jello mold &lt;i&gt;master!&lt;/i&gt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i&#039;m pretty sure, the pastel ones, have fruity flavours. there was probably a collision of chemicals that made the Wonderful Watergate Salad a little bit off. i also might have affected the colour.

now i am inspired to have a Lutheran Potluck theme party.

i blog my food adventures on myspace, not as picture intense, but fun nonetheless. cooking from scratch has become a Lost Art.]]></description>
