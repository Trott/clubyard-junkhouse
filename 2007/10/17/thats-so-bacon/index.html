      <div class="entry">
        <p>My beloved <a href="../../../03/23/how-to-be-loved-the-bacon-costume/index.html">bacon costume</a> has had some adventures lately:</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="../../../../images/make-magazine.jpg" alt="MAKE Magazine" title="MAKE Magazine" height=100 width=70 /></div>
<p><b>MAKE&#8217;n Bacon</b><br />
My bacon costume made it into <a href="http://makezine.com/magazine/"><i>MAKE Magazine</i></a>! I dig the blog, and it turns out the mag is pretty terrific, too. It&#8217;s a special Halloween issue, you can pick it up at bookstores &#038; a bunch of grocery stores, too. It&#8217;s a little steep for a magazine, at $10, but it&#8217;s money well spent. Check me out lookin&#8217; all cured and tasty on page 18! The bacon costume also got a shout-out on the <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2007/10/mmmmm_baconcostume.html">MAKE blog</a> today.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="../../../../images/garth-as-bacon.jpg" alt="Garth as Bacon" title="Garth as Bacon" height=240 width=140 /><br />
Garth as Bacon</div>
<p><b>Bacon On, Garth</b><br />
Garth over at Extreme Craft used my instructions <a href="http://extremecraft.typepad.com/extreme_craft/2007/09/bacon.html">to make his own bacon costume</a> for the Indie Craft Experience that went down in Atlanta a short while back. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/minches/528283770/">Look how dashing he is as bacon!</a> <i>(And Garth, I&#8217;m sorry for making the lame &#8220;party on&#8221; reference, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re beyond tired of it. I feel dirty for even saying it. But then I see your beaming, bacony face, and I feel clean again.)</i></p>
<p><b>Bacon Takes a College Road Trip</b><br />
One surreal morning a few months ago, a strange message popped into my email box: it was a plea from a director working on a Disney film, and he just <i>had</i> to have my bacon costume. The next morning. In Connecticut. Which is not very convenient from where I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p>
<p>I spent the rest of the morning, afternoon and evening working out logistics with the production office. First, they were going to send a courier to come get it, but no courier service would deal with it because it didn&#8217;t have a box. &#8220;Well, what do you normally ship it in?&#8221; was the query from the production office &#8212; I had to point out that I am not actually a prop shop, I&#8217;m just a weird chick with a bacon costume. The next plan was for them to buy two plane tickets, so I could fly the costume out in person, with the bacon costume seated next to me. I didn&#8217;t want to take time off work, but I had my friend <a href="http://www.gorilla-x.com">Mig</a> all lined up and ready to hop on a flight &#8212; he&#8217;s good for these random adventures, and I love him so for it. But then we weren&#8217;t sure if we&#8217;d be able to get the bacon costume through security. So, finally, the production office made arrangements for me to take the bacon costume to a UPS Store, where they made a custom box for it, and then I drove the bacon costume to American Airlines Cargo at the airport, and bacon was on its merry, salty way. It arrived in Stamford bright &#038; early the next morning, ready for its turn in the spotlight.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="../../../../images/omgravenlolwtf.jpg" alt="OMGRAVENLOLWTF?!?" title="OMGRAVENLOLWTF?!?" height=154 width=150 /><br />
OMGRAVENLOLWTF?!?</div>
<p>I have no idea how they actually used it, and of course there&#8217;s a decent chance it&#8217;ll just wind up on the cutting room floor. But it&#8217;s exciting nonetheless, and I look forward to bacon&#8217;s big debut. The film? Oh my, that&#8217;s the best part. It&#8217;s a Raven-Symoné vehicle. By Disney. With Martin Lawrence. Called College Road Trip. Please, please, please let Raven be the one they put in the bacon costume. That would be seven different kinds of rad.</p>
<p><b>You Know You Want To</b><br />
So, I got the costume back last week, and it&#8217;s in grand shape, ready for another outing. I loved being bacon last year for Halloween, but I think it&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s turn this year &#8212; anyone out there who lives in the Bay Area who wants to borrow it for Halloween? Make me an offer. Points for creativity over value in your offering. </p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Hi &#8211; I love the fact that you were bacon.  I thought of the idea on my own and found your blog when I was looking to buy a costume.  I totally get why you made your own &#8211; the professional ones are lame.  </p>
<p>So I&#8217;m looking forward to making my own. So I have couple of queations for you:<br />
1) Where did you find a foam shop (I live in the Bay Area too)?<br />
2) Is there any specific kind of paint that you recommend?</p>
<p>Thanks!  I can&#8217;t wait to send you photos (I&#8217;m going to be crispy!).</p>

I&#8217;m having a reunion with my two favorite girlfriends in Portland, OR for Halloween, and we&#8217;re going to be a BLT. I get to be the bacon! <img src='http://www.junkyardclubhouse.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />   (It was so kind of them to nominate me.) Would you be willing to mail your costume to Phoenix, AZ?</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Hello!  I live in Las Vegas, which is technically closer than Phoenix, if you are indeed willing to mail it, which I suspect you aren&#8217;t.  If I can find a way to San Francisco before Halloween and you haven&#8217;t found a more suitable borrower, I&#8217;d like to put in for it.  I once gained 15 pounds in a semester (in college) almost entirely from eating bacon.  Sometimes whole packages.  I have had a bacon party.  And I identify religiously as a Bacon Jew.  </p>
<p>Lovely costume, wonderful work.  </p>
<p>Have a great day!</p>
