		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t believe that I found this website.  I am also looking for the cutout book - I think the one I am interested in was published around 1973.  My Mom gave it to me when I married and I made the bunny cake, the hot air ballon and the baby carriage. Now I would like to make some of the cakes for my grandson but surprise, the book is among the missing.  Any thoughts as to where I can get a copy. Thanks Ladies!  Jo Mary]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi! Someone lent me a recipe for a 3d turkey cake that was formed with cut up cake and cookies for the feathers.  It was a folded magazine page and I think it was thrown away in error. She wants her recipe back and I have spent hours searching the internet for one to replace the one I lost.  She said it came from parents magazine or parenting magazine but no luck there so far. Has anyone seen it? Do you have a copy of it? I would gladly pay for a copy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would love to find the directions for a bicycle cut-up cake for my son&#039;s 50th birthday cake.  He is a cyclist and as he was growing up I made him a cut-up cake for his birthday every year.  He lives in Calif. , races his 10 speed bike and is coming to Florida for his birthday celebration.   I used to have the Baker&#039;s Coconut book, but I can&#039;t find it.  I believe they had another book where I found the bicycle.  Could you please help me?  He is coming on Feb. 5th.
