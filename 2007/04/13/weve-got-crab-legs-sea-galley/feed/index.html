    <description><![CDATA[Grew up in Bellevue with a Sea Galley beside a Uwagimaya.   My dad went on business trips frequently, many to Alaska in fact, and while he was gone it became a tradition for me and my mom to go tot he Sea Galley and eat together.  I really liked the place, but we moved to Portland in 1986.  Interestingly enough, one of the co-owners of Sea Galley started a second franchise called &quot;Flakey Jakes&quot;, right about 1983 or 1984.  It was a burger place, the first &quot;burger bar&quot; ever.  You could get 1/3 lb hot dogs and 1/2 lb burgers cooked to your liking, fries, and huge milk shakes.  They had the best video games too and the atmosphere, unlike Sea Galley, was more like being apart of a country ho-down in a barn.  We loved both places.    Sadly, Flakey Jakes over franchised, just as Sea Galley did and suffered from the intrusion of a competitor named Fuddruckers, much like Sea Galley suffered from Red Lobster.  We did find one last remaining Flakey Jakes in Danville, CA circa 1990 or so, but even that place closed.  I&#039;m glad to see Sea Galley is still alive in Yakima and Anchorage, I smell a road trip for piracy on the crab leg seas!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[This song has been stuck in my head since the 80s!  I grew up in Everett and remember the radio commercials that were a continuing soap opera they called &quot;All My Crablegs&quot;.  I think I was about 7 at the time; who says advertising doesn&#039;t work?!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know the whole story behind the ad, but my cousin was a co-founder of Sea Galley and he once told me about all their commercials, including this one. He said that they felt their crab legs was something worth showing off. They also had an ad with the actual, original Ronald McDonald costume. Ronald McDonald got fired because of this and Sea Galley got sued.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I was tortured by those Sea Galley adds.  I did not live close to a Sea Galley but only got to see the commercials.  I wanted nothing more than to go to that magical place with dancing chef/crab men.  I actually ate at a Sea Galley for the first time ever while traveling.  It was exciting for me, and sad to hear the waitress tell me that Sea Galley is a dying breed.  I described the commercials to my 14 year old son, and as I did so, I realized the concept of it sounded ridiculous.  But, from a child perspective it was the best ever.  I did order the crab legs when I ate there last month.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Of course I remember the song!  I was 12 in 1980, and I think anytime you had a group of boys together, running around, that song was bound to come up and singing ensued.
I also remember when they built the Sea Galley in Puyallup.  For Puyallup, and for that time, it was a BIG deal.  My sister in law went to a huge audition for a cocktail waitress position.  I remember she got the job and for a week I would grill her on every item on the menu.  The restaurant opened, the wait times were long, but it was the place to be in that little town.  The last time I was there, the building was still standing but the Sea Galley had been closed for years.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[LOL I was just thinking about Sea Galley and how much I loved it as a child... Haven&#039;t thought about it in years! Now I have that stupid crab leg song stuck in my head - haha! I, too, remember &quot;performing&quot; that commercial with my little friends in Salem, OR. Remember the birthday song that they sang - always ended with &quot;stand up, stand up, stand up and show us your face - your face!&quot; ... And they would sing it until you stood up?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[LOL! Thanks for this- my husband and I were just talking about Sea Galley- we had one in Fort Collins, Colorado-and it was SO popular!  I remember convincing my brother that we were actually at sea (he was 2 or 3.)  They had an awesome salad bar.  If I&#039;m ever in Yakima, I&#039;m definitely going to go!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I am really surprised at how much everybody on here seems to have loved the crab legs commercials, because for me, every time one of these came on TV, I RAN and hid behind the couch and covered my eyes and plugged my ears until it was over! I was completely TERRIFIED by the crab legged chefs! They gave me incredible nightmares.

Growing up in Kennewick, Washington, our Sea Galley was right down the street from our house (literally two blocks away). A year after these commercials came out, and after a pep talk from my dad, we had dinner there one night. After we got there, my dad mentioned to the waiter that I was massively afraid of their commercials, and the waiter, thinking he was being playful, said to me &quot;Oh, not to worry - the crab leg chefs are in the kitchen, cooking - they won&#039;t come out here.&quot;

I ran out the door, sprinting the two blocks back to the house, vowing never to go back.

Funny thing is, years later, my first job was as a bus boy at the same Sea Galley! John Sanchez was the Manager there, and he was great. I still remember him asking me during my interview: &quot;Are you a mover and a shaker? &#039;Cause that&#039;s what I need - a mover and a shaker.&quot; I learned the value of work in that place - lessons still resonating today.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[All the Skipper&#039;s are pretty much gone (the last one I remember going to was in 2007 in Auburn and I told myself that would be the last time, it was).  The quality really went downhill pretty drastically.  Ivar&#039;s is still around (The Captains Table on Elliott has been gone for awhile), still good, a little pricey.  Many of the Keg restaurants in the area (they replaced Sea Galley) are gone or are closing now.  Excluding the Crab Legs, the closest thing left around here to Sea Galley (even though it has a different theme) is Barnaby&#039;s at Southcenter.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Is there anyone in the Pacific Northwest who doesn&#039;t remember the Sea Galley &quot;crab legs&quot;
jingle?  There was a Sea Galley in Spokane, right across the street from the TV station
where I worked, and while I don&#039;t remember the food being all that spectacular, it was a
great place for happy hour. I&#039;ve lived in PA for the past 19 years, and it sure made me
feel nostalgic to watch the old Sea Galley ads on YouTube, along with the KST-Washington
news bumpers.  (Speaking of seafood, whatever happened to Skipper&#039;s?? They were great! Is
Ivar&#039;s still around?)]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Take a step back in time, visit the Sea Galley in Anchorage Alaska. Hosting over 10,000 guests a week, seating over 600, with two &quot;all you can eat&quot; salad bars (with baby corns). We are proud to support most of Sea Galleys original decore and menu items. The restaurant is run by a Manager that has worked for Sea Galley over thirty years. Sea Galley Alaska Now owns the Sea Galley Restaurant Names and Trademarks as well as the &quot;Weve Got Crab Legs&quot; trade marks. Come on in and see the old commercial story boards on the walls, nautical decore, complete with fresh oyster bar, fresh dessert bar, the old docks and village overhead.

Professional friendly staff, many over twenty years with Sea galley. We are still as fun a restaurant as Sea Galley ever was. Want to talk Alaskan fishing you have come to the right place.

Yes... We do have Crab Lags...]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I spent 3 years managing the Sea Galley in Walla Walla, it was indeed a great place to be at the time.  I started with them in Yakima so I know the store pretty well.  Your right on the changes, that ruined the whole deal, it all started with the stripped uniforms and went downhill from there!  I was just at the Yakima one a year ago and it is still as good as ever.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hello,
There is a SeaGalley in Yakima Wa. The only one left other than Anchorage. It is all original with the nets and booths.
It still has the salad bar and runs the Crab Legs commercial on the local radio and sometims of the T.V. If you are ever
in Eastern Washington its right off the freeway. They have the BEST appetizers especially the Cheese Sticks. The original
crab legs are sometimes worn to the Basketball games in Yakima to hand out coupons. Look up their webpage at seagally.com !!!!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I watched a few minutes of &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot; on Discovery Channel and, upon hoisting up a trap filled to the brim with crab, the Captain said &quot;We got crab legs!

    <description><![CDATA[Sea Galley had a great business, service and marketing model. Good food, great family environment and just plain enjoyable. Truly an all around treat. And, a good bargain. And, a fun place to go for everybody. Every lunch and dinner, every day the place was packed, even during Seattle&#039;s slow economy.

Then . . . the management went crazy, or got greedy, or something and decided to go &quot;yuppie&quot; (an 80&#039;s term) by totally changing their decor, making it more &quot;elegant&quot;; changing the menu to include haute cuisine and postage stamp portions; took away the salad bar; made it too stuffy to bring kids; hiked the prices way up.

The first time we went into one of the remodeled units (Totem Lake) was the last time we walked-in the door. Within weeks of making these changes you could go into a Sea Galley on a Friday evening and shoot a cannon through the place without hitting anyone.

To my experience, no one has come close to duplicating Sea Galley. Unfortunate indeed!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Hey!  I married snow crab. My friends that grew up in the Northwest had a good time mocking me for getting hitched to a crab legs guy.  Pretty funny.  Thanks for posting this, it gave us a good laugh.  Cheers,
