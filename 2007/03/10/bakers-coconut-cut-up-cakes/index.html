Baker&#8217;s Coconut Animal Cut-Up Cakes</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve had this up on my photo pages for a while, and it&#8217;s perfect for Junkyard Clubhouse. This <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/cutupcakes/">Animal Cut-Up Cakes booklet</a>, put out by Baker&#8217;s Coconut in 1959, has full-color photos and instructions to make about a dozen different animal-shaped cakes by cutting up standard size round and rectangular cakes &#8212; and then encrusting them with unnaturally tinted Baker&#8217;s Coconut, of course. That&#8217;s Dandy-Lion pictured there on the cover, I had him for my fifth birthday. My brother had Fanny the Fish for one of his early birthdays.</p>
<p>My grandmother probably ordered away for it, it wound up with my mother, and I&#8217;ve had it with me since I moved out of the house. Aside from my sentimental attachment to it, I also think it&#8217;s beautifully designed and photographed, and it is just <i>so</i> 1959 (right down to the illustrations of a housewife baking in a dress and high heels). I have <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/cutupcakes/">the whole thing scanned</a> and up at Humuhumu&#8217;s Life in Photos, where you can see Tortie the Turtle, Ella Elephant, Quack-Quack the Duck, and all their coconutty friends. </p>
<p>This booklet inspired me to create a cut-up cake of my own design, a hula girl &#8212; you&#8217;ll find directions for <a href="http://photo.humuhumu.com/v/cutupcakes/hulagirl/">her</a> there, too.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Wow!  Thanks so much for sharing this.  I too grew up with this book, and the picture of  Dandy-Lion is ingrained in my psyche.  I was just searching for a cake to make for a silly Pisces birthday party, and was remembering the book&#8230;  What a treat to find the whole thing!  The internet is truly a wonderful place.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Yeah, I found a bigger, later (1970s) book from Baker Coconut at an estate sale in Pasadena a few years ago; I still have it kicking around here somewhere. It&#8217;s got a lot more cakes in it, but the graphics just aren&#8217;t as cool, and the binding is less scanner-friendly. Someday I may scan in some of it.</p>

My daughter wanted a butterfly cake for her birthday and I knew exactly what I wanted to make her&#8230;.except mine was pink colored coconut when I was 8!  Love it!<br />
Love your website.  Reminds me of the book I found once called &#8220;Do you Remember?&#8221;.  Google it&#8230;it&#8217;s on amazon. It&#8217;s a great coffee table book of old toys, etc.  Very funny.  By the way&#8230;where is that book&#8230;</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I too lost my book from 1959 and tried a few years ago on the internet<br />
to find another copy.  Since then I found someone who had a copy and<br />
I was fortunate to be able to scan it.  I made many of the cakes and<br />
donated them to school and church raffles, they were always a big hit.l<br />
Tomorrrow is one of my children&#8217;s birthday and I am making either the<br />
fish or lion as I had done many, many years ago.  My daughter had a<br />
Better Homes &amp; Garden Junior Cookbook with a beautiful castle cake in<br />
it which I also made for one of my children.  During one of our many<br />
moves it too was lost.  I sure would like to find a copy of that so I<br />
could make it for one of my grandchildren.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>This is absolutely amazing and had to write, something I never do! Parents just celebrated their 50th and each child had to talk about a fond memory. My twin sister, we just turned forty 1 week ago talked about how she loved her<br />
Lion cake growing up. My mom is having lunch with her this week and was I suggested to her<br />
to make it. So hence went searching and found this site. Have the newer book in Candada from the<br />
1990&#8242;s but it nowhere near as nice as the original and we are all trying to find out who<br />
has the original.</p>

I too am searching for a copy of this book&#8230;was so glad to find your website.<br />
(My Mom lost hers as well) Check onE-Bay, sometimes one of these will come up<br />
for auction.  There are similiar booklets from the 1960s, one has bunny on cover;<br />
but the 1959 booklet,(w/ Lion on cover)always recives the highest bids. I&#8217;ve seen<br />
it go for as much as $70&#8230;.no kidding! I guess we all have fond memories of those<br />
simpler times &amp; nostalgia always sells.</p>
<p>P.S. If you can find a listing (on E-Bay) that has miscellaneous cook books<br />
combined for one auction, sometimes it has the 1959 Baker&#8217;s Coconut in it&#8230;good luck!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I so enjoyed your pictures of all those cut up cakes.  Thank You for sharing.  I got this book<br />
when I was 12 years old.  Prior to it, I believe it was in 1956, I got another one with a rabbits<br />
head on it,titled &#8220;Cut Up Cakes.&#8221;  Then I sent for the next one in 1968, titled &#8220;Baker&#8217;s Coconut &amp; Chocolate Party<br />
Cut Up Cakes.&#8221; Then, in 1970, I got one with a &#8220;Train&#8221; on the front of it. I used them for all of my children<br />
and Grandchildren.  So fun.  Then, I gave them to my daughter and have decided that I would like to purchase the<br />
1956 Cut Up Cakes and the 1959 Animal Cut Up Cakes, again.  Do you know of any place where I might find them for sale?<br />
Funny to think at the ripe old age of 9 years old, I started my collection!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I have both the 1959 &#8220;Animal Cut-Up Cakes&#8221; and 1970 (can&#8217;t find a date on it) &#8220;Cut-Up Cake Party Book&#8221; editions of the Baker&#8217;s Coconut books. I inherited the 1959 edition from my mom.  I was 8 1/2 in 1957 when my little sister was born, was quite the little baker, so made one of the cakes from the 1959 edition for her birthday every year and others for different occasions (Spot the Fox Terrier since we had one &#8211; Suzie).  My daughter was born on Christmas Eve in 1974, so I continued to make her the cut-up cakes after purchasing the 1970 edition.  I&#8217;ve made all 16 from the 1959 edition and most of the 26 from the 1970 edition.  She called yesterday wanting to make one for her neighbor girl, turning 3, which led me to googling the books and to this site.  What fun to read about everyone else&#8217;s memories!  I am now in the process of copying both books so I can send her the originals.  It&#8217;s her turn to enjoy them!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I had all of these books for my children. I also believe that I made them all.  My son is a Leo, and I made him the Lion on his birthday.  He was so proud of that cake. My mother in-law had never had a special cake made for her, and I made her the beautiful Butterfly.  I have pictures of her, and my children with the cakes I made over the years.  On Easter I would always make the Bunny Cake.  I would love to have a copy of this book &#8211; as mine has disappeared.  I probably loaned it to someone and never got it back.  Thanks for the wonderful memories.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Hi,<br />
Several here are interested in finding the 1959 Cut Up Cakes booklet&#8230;  After asking my mom for her&#8217;s (apparently lost in a move) </p>
<p>I searched on E-Bay and found a one in mint condition.  I paid less than $10. for mine, but you have to pick and choose the auctions&#8230;apparently, everyone that remembers this cookbook wants one!  Often, there will be so many bidding that the price will climb astronomically.  More than one auction I &#8220;watched&#8221; ended at over $50!!! </p>
<p>There is another similiar &#8220;cut up cakes&#8221; booklet, which has a white bunny cake on front&#8230;  I&#8217;ve seen it on E-Bay as well.  Good luck!</p>

I know she made several of them if not all of them over the years. I always wanted the dog cake and never got. My birthday is comming up soon and I told her that it would be fun to get the dog cake that I always wanted. She said she could not find her cake book so thank you for posting some of the cakes on your site.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>When my mother passed away 3 years ago I was looking through her cookbooks and all I wanted was this little booklet of cut up cakes.  It is very sad that I have so little happy childhood memories, my mother every birthday would let us kids pick a cake and I or my brothers or sisters who evers birthday it was helped make and decorate it.  I loved my mother so much, she was married to my alcoholic abusive father,and tried to make us kids happy she did her best with what little she had that was all she could have done in those days,  but this little booklet was never found, till now thank you I am going to share it with my grandchildren, just to let you know I am writting this through tears in my eyes.

Luckily I ended up with her copy and several articles on cut-up cakes that Mom must have gotten from old magazines.

Money was so tight and it was her claim to fame, that she could always present these lovely desserts for (now I know) little cost. I made them faithfully throughout the &#8217;70s and early &#8217;80s for my own small ones. With money being tight again, it&#8217;s time to bring back this fun art. Thank you so much for your effort in this!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I had this book when it first came out. My mother and I made Fanny the Fish for my father&#8217;s birthday, it was the first one we made.  My aunt made the Bunny every easter when I was a child.  Over the years I think I made almost every one of the cakes in the book.  I had to sell my house about 12 years ago and didn&#8217;t have room to store much.  I gave my cookbooks to my daughters but they can&#8217;t find the cut up cake book.  I am so happy to find it on you web site.  Thanks for much for taking the time to put it on the web.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only two circus animals .. the lion on the cover and an elephant.  There&#8217;s also a giraffe, but I don&#8217;t know if that qualifies.</p>
<p>I think my mother-in-law had (has?) a different one.  She makes the big easter bunny face cake that she claims came from that book.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I have both of the Baker&#8217;s Cut Up Cakes booklets.  The first one is copyrighted 1956 and features a different cake for each month of the year!  The witch for October is especially endearing.  When I was young, my mother made a cut up cake for just about every birthday for my brothes, sisters and I!  I am so pleased to have both booklets now!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>When I was younger, my Mom had two different cake decorating books from Bakers Coconut. On e was the one we see here. The other one had a cake for every month of the year. I&#8217;d like to try to get a hold of copies of each of them. If you could give me an idea where to look I&#8217;d appreciate it. thanks.
