      <div class="entry">
        <p>I&#8217;ve kind of got a thing for armadillos. I&#8217;ve never seen one in person &#8212; a live one, at least&#8230; I saw a squished one at the side of the road once when I was in Texas for a business trip. I can rattle off random armadillo facts for you (They&#8217;re born as litters of identical quadruplets! The only one that can roll up into a perfect ball is the three-banded armadillo! The pink fairy armadillo is only four inches long! They carry leprosy!), but I think you&#8217;ll be much more interested in this:</p>
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="../../../../images/my-armadillo-handbag.jpg" alt="My armadillo purse" title="My armadillo purse" height=343 width=500 /><br />
My armadillo purse</div>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="../../../../images/lined-with-pink-satin.jpg" alt="Lined with pink satin!" title="Lined with pink satin!" height=201 width=200 /><br />
Lined with pink satin!</div>
<p>Your eyes do not deceive you: this is a purse, made of an actual, real armadillo. It&#8217;s been bent around into a sort of football shape, clutching itself with its sweet little claws, and with rhinestones for eyes. It&#8217;s lined in pink satin, and has a mirror under its neck so you can check your lipstick. It is fancy. </p>
<p>I got this as a gift from my mom, who also has a thing for armadillos. She found it for me more than ten years ago, I have no idea where, and I don&#8217;t know how old it is. I&#8217;ve heard that they used to sell these down near the border in Texas, and that they were a popular tourist item.<br clear=left /></p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>That is the coolest thing I have EVER seen.<br />
I mean, sorry the poor beast had to give it up so someone could own a purse,<br />
but this little fella probably got taken out by a truck. Heck, armadillos<br />
in the south are like raccoons up here (Canada), but I don&#8217;t think a raccoon<br />
purse would be quite so cool.</p>
<p>I might not walk around town toting my armadillo purse, but I&#8217;d<br />
love to have one as a conversation item.<br />
It&#8217;s actually quite striking in design &#8212; and did I say &#8220;cool&#8221;.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I was just talking to a friend about an armadillo purse I received a long, long time ago<br />
and decided to look it up on the internet to see if any other purses existed. To my<br />
amazement, I came upon this site. I am shocked that my purse is exactly like this one<br />
but I don&#8217;t know the origin, significance or value of it and was searching to find an answer.<br />
The lady who gave it to me was very old at the time and I was about 10 years old and<br />
never thought to ask questions about it. If you know anything please let me know.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I have 2 full armadillo purses.  The tail comes up and over the back and connects behind the head to make a handle, the inside is hollowed out and lined and the top of the back opens up with a circular zipper and there is a mirror there. They have jewels in the eye sockets.  One was my mom&#8217;s and she used it in the 60&#8242;s &#8211; 70&#8242;s and one was my aunt&#8217;s.  They are pretty cool and have been sitting atop a bookshelf in my house as decorations.  They are banned now, and I don&#8217;t believe it is legal to import them from Mexico any more. I recently had cancer and lost my home, will be homeless Oct. 1st and so am getting rid of everything I have, unfortunately, these purses need to go. I can send photos and will ship them&#8230;I can also accept payment through paypal.</p>

<p>I just love it; it&#8217;s lined with a maroon felt-type material and in perfect condition. Good idea about adding brass feet to it; I&#8217;ll do that. I just hope I won&#8217;t get hassled &#8220;wearing&#8221; it in San Francisco!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I have this same purse that I purchased when I was 17 in Tijuana, Mexico at a purse store.  My best friend and I talked the guy down in price. He wanted $30 each and we both bought one so he gave it to us for $25 each.  I am now 42 so this price was quite some time ago! The inside of mine is also maroon and it has bright green bead eyes. Mine looks exactly like the picture. We thought they were Cool! I still just love mine.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>My husband purchased a armadillo purse years ago, at a yard sale. It has just been sitting on a shelf. It&#8217;s in excellent condition. It&#8217;s football shaped, has green beaded eyes, a oval clasp, gold with red color. There is a compact mirror inside the lid, still intact. The purse has a long braided handle attached to the purse. If anyone is interested in buying this, please leave a message at e-mail address. Would like to see it go to someone who would really like to have it.</p>
