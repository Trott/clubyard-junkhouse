		<description><![CDATA[Oh, I&#039;m so glad you like it. It feels good to have one&#039;s dairy preferences validated by others. I may have to break down and try the dessert-y flavors.

Is there a Whole Foods near you? The one near us carries a pretty wide lineup of Brown Cow yogurt. The Safeways around us carry it, too, but they only have a few flavors. Maybe if you ask for it at your nearest Safeway clone, they&#039;ll start stocking it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay. I had to do the taste test for myself, but first I had to find Brown Cow. The only stores anywhere close to me that carry it are all in the entirely SDA city of Loma Linda. I stopped on 
my way home from work this evening at Clark&#039;s Nutritional Center. I bought the full fat cherry vanilla and the fat free chocolate. The cherry vanilla was fabulous, but I do actually plan on marrying the fat free chocolate. Oh my God! Thanks for turning me on to this stuff.]]></description>
