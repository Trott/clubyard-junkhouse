		<description><![CDATA[Yeah so i watch this video like 3-6 times everyday. It puts a smile on my face. A great way to start the day. The dance definatly fits better to &quot;Walk It Out&quot;. The changes from the courus to verse to riffs. its freakin perfect. Kudos to Gwen and her girls. They definatly walk it out. She was in over 15 movies and like 7 theater shows.]]></description>
