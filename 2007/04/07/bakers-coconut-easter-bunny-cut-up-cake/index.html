      <div class="commenttext"><p>Is it possible for me to get a copy of the 1973 cut-out book?  My mother-in-law had a copy of this recipe from an old magazine in the 70&#8242;s and she loaned it to me.  Unfortunately, my dog chewed it up! Help!  I need to replace it, and I have been searching the internet trying to find a duplicate of the article.  I would love to get her this book as a peace offering.  Thanks for your help.</p>

However, since these books are very tattered (at least 40 years later!), I am interestered in obtaining a new or re-printed &#8220;Cut-Up Cake&#8221; book(s).  Is this possiible?  Do you have new designs? </p>

I made these cakes for my daughters, and would now like to make them for my grandchildren.<br />
I would even be willing to pay for photo copies of the books pages.  Thank you.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Wow, My Mom and I were just talking about the Bakers Coconut Cut Up Cakes at Christmas.<br />
I remember her making the Elenphant for my birthday one year.<br />
That was/in one of my Favorite Recipe Books of all time. It would take me literally hours<br />
to look at the 16 cakes to decide what I wanted Mom to make for me.<br />
This brings back such good memories.<br />
If anyone knows how I can get one of the books please let me know. Or if anyone would be<br />
willing to make me some colored full size copies that would be great. I would pay up you<br />
a reasonable price.<br />
Thanks,<br />

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Oh! I stumbled acropss your site while checking for a possible Bunny Cake recipe. I had a sudden nostalgic memory of the cut-up cakes. I remember too growing up in the 70s and flipping through my mom&#8217;s well battered copy of the animal cut-ups. I can still picture the cakes on her big foil covered pastry board! Thanks for the memories and for the bunny cake scan!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Does anyone know where I can get a photocopy of the 1956 Baker&#8217;s coconut book &#8220;A Calendar of New Cake-Making Ideas&#8221; which features a themed cake for each month of the year?  I am willing to pay for it.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I also was looking for a copy of the books.I recall making the cakes for my children, they enjoyed cutting the licorice and gum drops. we even took a few drops of green color and added it to the coconut for a background around the bunny.I recall the umbrella but can&#8217;t remember how to cut it out.There was also a hat.All I can say we had fun..make copies of everything you make, you&#8217;ll be glad years down the line. Enjoy your children as they grow up too fast.</p>
