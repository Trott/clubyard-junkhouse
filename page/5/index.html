<p>I was having dinner with a friend of mine two weeks ago, and she asked me what kind of music I listen to. In reality I listen to a lot of stuff &#8212; too diverse to lump into a single category &#8212; but for a few years now I&#8217;ve jokingly used the term <b>Electro-Acoustic  Soundscapes of the 70s</b>. (My friend Martin coined that phrase after unsuccessfully searching through my iPod for 80s music). She had no clue what kind of music I was talking about and she pressed on, so I half-seriously elaborated with &#8220;You know, electronic boops and beeps, like outer-space stuff&#8221; even though I mostly <i>don&#8217;t</i> listen to that; it&#8217;s just a small sliver of my collection. And then the conversation moved on. </p>
<p>Little did I know that the 30 seconds I spent rattling off that term would pay me back so heartily. The next week she invited me out to a bar in San Francisco and warned me not to be late.  After a quick drink, we walked down the street a few blocks until we came to an old looking wood-paneled building.</p>
<p>Opening the door revealed a museum-esque interior with a ticket booth, stationed by a very distinguished looking older woman.  We purchased two tickets at $15 each, and we&#8217;re handed two programs labeled <b>Audium: A Theatre In Sound-Sculptured Space.</b> At this point my friend tells me that she remembered me talking about electronic beeps and whooshes from the previous week, found out about this place just by blind luck, and took me here sight-unseen because she thought it might &#8220;have some of that kind of beeping stuff in it&#8221;. Little did she know how right she was. </p>
<p>We stepped into a <i>very</i> serious looking room filled with sound-related sculptures as well as an array of speakers playing ambient noise: gentle water gurgling, hummingbirds zipping from one side of the room to the other. But this was just the lobby. Clearly this place was built in the 70s, and it looked like not much had changed. And after a bit of waiting around, the ambient noises got louder and the lights in the lobby grew dim, at the same time a spotlight appeared on a wood-paneled hexagonal door, where an gray-haired gentleman appeared.  </p>
<p>He informed us and the other two dozen-or-so people in the lobby that we were about to enter the Audium, where we would be treated to a 139 speaker audio-performance-in-the-round dealing with &#8220;space and time travel&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it was going to be completely in the dark. For an hour. </p>
<p>And then we went inside. The theater itself looks as if the designers were going for <b>2001: A Space Odyssey</b> but instead ended up with a set from <b>Dr. Who</b>. It was exactly what I was hoping for. The theater is arranged in a circle, with speakers all over the place &#8230; hanging from the ceiling, built into the walls, and under grates on the floor. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.audium.org/audium_1.jpg">
<div class="imgbox aligncenter"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/audium.jpg" alt="Audium" title="Audium"/></div>
<p></a></p>
<p>The real kicker, however, was when the lights dimmed out to complete blackness and the experience started. The soundtrack was straight out of the 1970s and didn&#8217;t sound like it had ever been updated (although I found out later that it had). But this was not music. Electronic beeps and boops were everywhere, &#8220;flying&#8221; through air, along with droning Wagnerian-style synth power chords, abruptly shifting to lo-fi organic recordings of nature, before popping back to beeps. Despite the 139 speakers in use, most of it sounded like it was just coming out of the four big speakers in each corner. It was largely rhythmless, and had no apparent story arc or narrative that was discernible from just listening.  And the fidelity matched the decor. This was cliche 70s sci-fi art-school-project-on-drugs sound effects with a dash of the Space Mountain queue soundtrack thrown in. And it just kept going and going.  </p>
<p>Half way through the performance there was a 5 minute (lighted) intermission and half the audience left, never to return. At this point I turned to my friend and asked her if she had it in her to listen to the second half, because she had no clue going into this what she was in for, isn&#8217;t into electronic music, and even I was kinda worn out by it. But she was gung-ho for soldiering through the second half &#8230; which ended up feeling like it was twice as long as the first half. </p>
<p>After the show was over, I was in shock. An hour in the dark listening to 1970s sound effects will do that to you. A zillion questions raced through my mind. Why have I never heard of this place? How did my friend find it? How has it not changed since the 70s? Why were they still getting crowds? I desperately wanted to talk to the gray haired guy, who turns out is the founder and sound designer, but I was worried he was going to chew my already-tired ear off with space and time travel theories. </p>
<p>The entire night was a completely surreal experience. If you&#8217;re into the mid century space-age movement at all, you need to go check the Audium out before it closes or gets remodeled. Even though I didn&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; what the soundtrack was about, and I thought it was a little long to sit through, I absolutely loved it and now I want to take all my friends. It&#8217;s definitely worth doing once for the sheer novelty effect even if you&#8217;re not into electronic music. But you better go soon &#8230; it really feels like it could close its doors for good any second.  </p>

<p>Audium 8 is performed every Friday and Saturday at 8:30pm. Price $15<br />
Arrive by 8 pm since part of the fun is the lobby.<br />

<p>*For the record, the 1970s electronic music I prefer is actual music, with percussion, melody, and harmony. The Audium had none of that.  And yes, I did apologize to my friend for fibbing a little about my musical tastes. </p>

            <div class="entry">
                <p>On Thanksgiving I had my family over and my nephew was mesmerized by my <a href="/2007/11/27/knex-coffee-table-end-table/index.html">K’nex end table</a>. I think he loved the idea that a grown-up had used toys to make something so functional and had it proudly displayed in the house. He asked if I had any more K’nex left over because he wanted to play with them. I dug my box of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K'NEX">K’nex</a> parts out of the closet for him, and it got me thinking about building with K’nex again. The table was the only thing I had made with it, and that was over ten years ago.</p>
<div class="imgbox alignleft"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/ikea-lamp.jpg" alt="ikea-lamp" title="ikea-lamp"/><br />The light element<br />used in the lamp.</div>
<p>A few nights later I found myself sleepless again and in the mood for some good old fashioned pen-on-paper writing and illustration. Normally I’d do that during the day at a coffee shop, but it was late and I found myself without a desk lamp! I rummaged through my lighting box looking for something suitable and came across a little IKEA-style accent light.</p>
<p>Immediately I thought of rigging up something with K’nex to hold it in the air so that I wouldn’t get long shadows when writing. A few hours later the first version of the K’nex lamp was complete. Of course, by then the mood to write had passed. The next day I spent a few more hours refining and improving it. It’s stands about two feet tall. Like the table, it uses no glue.   </p>

<p>The K&#8217;nex coffee table / end table is my own creation dating back to 1995. It was very late at night and, as usual, I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I had needed a coffee table for quite some time but hadn&#8217;t gotten around to buying one. I did however, have a huge collection of K&#8217;nex toys. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.knex.com/">K&#8217;nex</a> is like a plastic version of Tinkertoys, with two basic types of pieces: rods and connectors. They snap together and their sizes are mathematically designed to make triangles and boxes and whatnot. Unlike LEGO, the color of a K&#8217;nex piece determines it&#8217;s type, for example all the rods of one color are the same length. This means creating something with specific colors is somewhat of a challenge. K&#8217;nex pieces fit together pretty snugly, &#8212; in fact, after playing with them for a few hours my fingers hurt from all the pressure needed to connect and disconnect them. </p>
<div class="imgbox alignright"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/knex-end-table-004.jpg" alt="K'nex End Table" title="K'nex End Table"/></div>
<p>So, back to that sleepless night. I had a disassembled K&#8217;Nex kit of the <a href="http://orgs.bloomu.edu/msc/Center%20Stuff/K'NEX%20Pictures/K'Nex%20Ball%20Factory%20(large).jpg">Big Ball Factory</a>. There were a lot of pieces in it. I figured there were probably enough to make a decent coffee table. I didn&#8217;t realize the task I was taking on though; because designing a table that won&#8217;t sag in the middle or collapse when any kind of serious <a href="http://www.willbeta.com/lose-weight-exercise/"><span style="display:none;">Lose </span>Weight<span style="display:none;"> Exercise</span></a> is put on it is a challenge. While building it I had to redesign it several times to make it strong enough. The sun was up when I finished, and the table stood proud at 5 feet long and 1.2 feet tall. It uses no glue, but it holds a lot of <a href="http://www.willbeta.com/lose-weight-exercise/"><span style="display:none;">Lose </span>Weight<span style="display:none;"> Exercise</span></a>. I never got photos of it in this configuration. </p>
<p>A few years later I moved to a new location and decided what I really needed was an end table. So I took a bit out of the middle, and increased the height of the legs, and the coffee table was transformed into an end table. It&#8217;s now about 2 feet tall and 2.5 feet wide. Every once in a while I&#8217;ll clean it and fix a few disconnected rods. I use it like a real table, and it works fine. It uses no glass, but the surface works well even though it&#8217;s got plenty of holes. Containers with non-flat bottoms like Coke or water bottles need a coaster, and that&#8217;s about it for special treatment. Although it&#8217;s been through a  lot (including the ire of disapproving tastemakers) it has never collapsed.  Enjoy the photos. -Hanford</p>

<p>I had a last-second idea for a super-quick Halloween costume: the Gold Paint Huffer guy. For those not in the know, the Gold Paint Huffer guy is an minor Internet Celebrity made famous by his unfortunate mug shot (image on the left). He&#8217;s seen staring blankly into the camera in a way that only a true huffer can, his face covered in gold paint, and wearing a creepy scowl reminiscent of an angry stroke victim. The photo is both tragic yet hysterical. </p>
<p>The costume idea popped into my head literally right as I walked by <strike>a party store</strike> Halloween Headquarters on the day of. Five minutes later and two bucks poorer I was the proud new owner of a do-it-yourself Gold Paint Huffer kit: a tube of gold facepaint.  However, later that night I realized my friend <a href="http://www.pownce.com/chadspacey/">Chad Spacey</a> was a much better fit for the look, and he was really into it. At the end of the evening we busted out the camera for an impromptu photo shoot: </p>

&#8220;We Are Apple,&#8221; uploaded by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbJy0O4UFSM">adiblasi</a></div>
<p>So, I broke down and bought an iPhone (about 20 minutes after the price drop was announced) &#8212; my first purchase of an Apple product. I didn&#8217;t even have an iPod, that&#8217;s how out if it I&#8217;ve been. Of course, now I&#8217;ve drunk the Apple Kool-Aid, and I think this phone is the greatest thing since, I dunno, the Newton. It&#8217;s fab (especially now that we&#8217;ll get some legit third-party apps soon). But this video is fabber.</p>

Make it Happen</div>
<p>This has been kicking around in low-quality form for awhile, but this version was uploaded to YouTube by someone who was at the video&#8217;s original mid-&#8217;80s presentation, and he had a high-quality copy. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hen I saw this &#8216;live&#8217; at the Mac introduction, we, as Apple Dealers, all LAUGHED OUR ASSES OFF at time marker 02:47 &#8211; when the guy carried a 60 pound LISA computer under his arm like it was a laptop!</p></blockquote>
<p>What I really want to know is &#8212; where did this wooden sign wind up? I hope it&#8217;s still up in someone&#8217;s cube in Cupertino.</p>

Electric Punch Light Fantasy</div>
<p>Check out this atrocity: it&#8217;s a cheap, plastic, tiered <a href="http://www.target.com/Nostalgia-Electrics-Lighted-Punch-Fountain/dp/B000HK047W/sr=1-1/qid=1191790863/ref=sr_1_1/601-4497561-3095304?ie=UTF8&#038;index=target&#038;rh=k%3Afountain&#038;page=1">punch bowl fountain</a>, and it lights up. And because that&#8217;s not tacky enough, the lights cycle through different colors. I&#8217;ll tell you what it&#8217;s missing, though: it needs a sprig of fiber optics on the top. Now <i>that</i> would be fancy.</p>
<p>I kind of secretly want it. A lot.</p>
