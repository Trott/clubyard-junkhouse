		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d never heard of them. They kind of look like animatronics from a cut-rate Chuck E. Cheese ripoff. 

They look like they smell musty. The Banana Splits, on the other hand, look like they smell like Froot Loops. Catchy little ditty, though!]]></description>

She&#039;s a total packrat, so I&#039;d bet money she still has them. I&#039;ll send a picture if they&#039;re someplace that&#039;s easily accessible.]]></description>
