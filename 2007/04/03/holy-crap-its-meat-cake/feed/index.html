		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I&#039;m having a hard time selling Hanford on it. I suggested just trying to make meat cupcakes, but he thought that might just be worse -- too cute to be meaty.

I&#039;m trying to think of the best way to incorporate bacon into the design. My current line of thought: what if I rolled up a strip of bacon, into a rosette sort of shape, secured it somehow (toothpick? temporary thread?), and then deep-fried it... I wonder if, with a little practice, it might come out looking like a very lovely bacon rose, suitable for cake-topping?]]></description>

but maybe if they covered it with bacon instead, and the inside meat was corned beef with heinz mustard inner frosting it just might take the cake.  nerrrrr, dork pun alert!]]></description>
