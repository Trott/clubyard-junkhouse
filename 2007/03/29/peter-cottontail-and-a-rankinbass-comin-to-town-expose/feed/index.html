		<description><![CDATA[I believe that&#039;s correct, on both counts! It&#039;s got Casey Kasem &amp; Danny Kaye, too. I&#039;m not sure I&#039;ll be able to hear Casey Kasem&#039;s voice without expecting it to stop to make a very special dedication of a song.

Great blog title, btw! That tiny tiki you found is a Westwood W-4 toothpick holder. You can look through the Westwood mugs on &lt;a href=http://www.ooga-mooga.com rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Ooga-Mooga&lt;/a&gt; to learn more. There isn&#039;t a template (yet!) for the W-4 toothpick holder, but there are templates for other items in the W-4 line, and there&#039;s one for the W-1 toothpick holder.  (I wanted to leave a comment on your blog, but Blogger wasn&#039;t letting me do that without a Blogger account).]]></description>
