		<description><![CDATA[Crpeoplemover, thanks for sharing that link! Interesting to hear it from the perspective of someone from Mexico. That&#039;s a shame that It&#039;s a Small World was closed during your visit (it&#039;s neat to see the differences there, but Disneyland&#039;s is way better). I hope you got to see the Mary Blair murals at the Contemporary. LA LA LA LA LA, LA LA LA LA LA LA LA!

Moose, great to see you here! Reality is seriously overrated. You live in the Bay Area, don&#039;t you? You should come check out Forbidden Island in Alameda sometime, if you&#039;re jonesing for a great themed environment, with the added bonus of tasty alcohol (we&#039;re headed there tonight for our weekly dose of tiki ourselves).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I wrote a tribute/tour of &quot;Rio&quot; on my blog:

http://crpeoplemover.blogspot.com/2007/05/el-rio-del-tiempo-1982-2007.html

I&#039;m devastated that it&#039;s gone! Best ride ever! You hit all the major points. I mistakingly called the marionettes, puppets, I&#039;ll have to go back and fix that.

You have great Disney taste!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just a slight correction -- those projections were not video, they were film projections, complete with 1982-sized film grain &amp; gate jitter and 25 years worth of dust, scratches, and duplication artifacts.

awwww ... I am going to miss those hot-tubbers.]]></description>
