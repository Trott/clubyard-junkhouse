        <p><a href="http://thebooberryalarmclock.blogspot.com/2007/05/frightening-dummies.html">The Booberry Alarmclock</a> posted some photos of a ventriloquist doll (it&#8217;s no dummy!), and this reminded me of this public safety tip: <a href="http://www.tikiroom.com/tikicentral/bb/viewtopic.php?topic=6274&#038;forum=6">How to tell if your ventriloquist puppet is evil</a>:
<div class="imgbox alignright"><a href="http://thebooberryalarmclock.blogspot.com/2007/05/frightening-dummies.html"><img src="http://images.hanfordlemoore.com/willie-talk-no-willie-kill-you.jpg" alt="Willie talk? No. Willie kill you? Yes!" title="Willie talk? No. Willie kill you? Yes!"/></a></div>
<p>1. Make a large, roaring fire. </p>
<p>2. Within earshot of the doll say “Well, I think it’s about time I get rid of this ventriloquist doll … it’s not doing me any good no more”. </p>
<p>3. Pick up the doll and say “I think this will burn up real good in the fire”</p>
<p>4. Walk towards the fire. </p>
<p>5. Make like you’re going to throw the doll into the fire on the count of 3.</p>
<p>At this point, if your doll is evil, you’ll feel a bite on your arm, or a punch, or some other violent reaction. The doll will try to get out of your grasp, and, if successful, will run away, most likely with an evil cackle out of it’s smiling mouth.  Be careful … he’s not fleeing from you; he’s only looking for a place to hide in order to attack you later. </p>
<p>If nothing happens, your doll is probably not evil. You now have 2 choices:  Throw it into the fire anyway, or put it away. </p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> If you do not throw the doll in the fire, it is suggested that you take a knife with you to bed. It’s possible the doll <i>is</i> evil but knew you were testing it, and is waiting for you to go to sleep before attempting to strangle you. </p>

<p>This way, maybe, you will be chosen to give up your soul and have the evil puppet take over your body.</p>
<p>Then, this hot little evil puppet, played by Jennifer Tilly, will be your girlfriend, and the two of you can do all sorts of evil puppet things forever and ever&#8230;</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I am serious about this. I tresspassed in an older house that was abandoned. I found an old wooden ventriloquist dummy in perfect condition in its case.<br />
I brought it home. (Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!) One night while I was alone in my house I herd a small child like giggle. I went upstairs and when I got to the room where the dummy was. Its eyes turned by themselves and the mouth started opening and closing frantically. After its episode, I burned it up in a bomb fire at a party. It has never come back. I moved. But I later learned that the family who bought my house my house, a family of five, every last one had been murdered in the house one night. All of them strangled.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>This is friggin&#8217; hilarious!  But, a few weeks ago I watched &#8220;Dead Silence&#8221; with my boyfriend. &#8220;Beware the stare of Mary Shaw, she had no children, only dolls.  If you see her in your dreams, be sure you never, ever scream&#8221;&#8230;.and then there&#8217;s something about if you scream, she&#8217;ll rip your tongue out. It freaked me out so bad!  Ventriloquist dolls scare me.  I&#8217;d totally believe this and either burn the doll or take a knife to bed with me.  On second thought, I&#8217;d burn the doll AND take a knife to bed with me.  You can never be sure&#8230;.</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I am laughing so hard right now &amp; my stomach hurts from reading all the replys. I had one of those Willie Talk dolls &amp; someone drew a flaming red hot butt hole on his butt &amp; wrote, &#8220;It&#8217;s Chapped&#8221;. I did not discover it until i changed his clothes &amp; no one fessed up to it cause i would beat the crap out of them. I then told all my sisters &amp; brothers that Willie would get his revenge on who ever disfigured him &amp; it would be with a knife from our kitchen drawer. My youngest sister, GINA was screaming &amp; swearing she did not do it &amp; i said, if you did not do it then he would not hurt you, only the one who did that to him. Needless to say, no one died nor did anyone ever confess to drawing a red butt hole on my favorite toy which i got at a Goodwill store, hey, puppets need a home too. Schroeder</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>Silly humans, you make fun of us dolls &amp; yet you won&#8217;t be laughing when we have our global attack &amp; i will be the leader. I Willie Talk &amp; my other Willie brothers will get our revenge for all the mistreatings we received in the past, for every slam to the ground, for every tug of war you played with our arms, for every rotten tea party you put us through, we will rise &amp; attack, you will become our playmates &amp; sit on our laps. We&#8217;ve gathered knives &amp; forks &amp; especially socks, yes socks. You know all those socks that disappear in the dryer, well they just didn&#8217;t disappear, us dolls took them so when we attack in the night we have something to gag your loud mouths with, there’s nothing more annoying than to hear a human screaming, it only upsets us more. Yes many of us went through the fire test &amp; some of us survived, ran away but we are here to stand up for the ones who burned at your grace, we will be their hands, their feet &amp; speak for them when we attack. My girlfriend Barbie will be at my side, many of her sisters have drowned in your bathtubs or in a flushing toilet. You humans are so cruel to us dolls, we’ve been burned with dripping melting crayons, singed with magnifying glasses, our faces melted off on the stove burner, our heads cut off by your rotten little brothers &amp; it goes on &amp; on &amp; on. We dolls have not forgotten how you have treated us &amp; we plan to take our revenge slowly, oh so slowly. Barbie’s little sister Skipper thought of this little diddy &amp; I will be the first to try it out. You know all those potato peelers that come up missing in your kitchen drawers? Well, we have them all! We plan on tying you humans up to a chair &amp; gently peeling your skin away like that of a potato &amp; then pour salt all over you, we can’t wait. We will need drones to help us out so if any of you humans wish to live then the magic word is, “Chatty Cathy” &amp; the attack will stop on you. Have a pleasant night boys &amp; girls, you adults too, even though your full grown your still gonna get it. Willie &amp; Barbie</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>hey im billie. i see my pal willie has told you about us. well he and some of his friends may be nice enough to let you go by saying the oh so magic words of chatty chatty. but i will not! you will still die and i will like it. ill eat wuts rest of you. but what i didnt tell you is ill do it with you and your most 3 loved ones at the same time. and the only way ill consider stopping is if you eat the pealed skin off of each other after it is pealed. i do oh so enjoy the sound of human screams, unlike my friend willie, it makes him unhappy, he enjoys not the screams, but the taste of you brats! it gives me a warm chilly feeling to have heard the beautiful, priceless sound of a humans scream! us dolls aren&#8217;t &#8220;evil&#8221; we&#8217;re seeking revenge. we only need 100 more people to say we are evil to piss us off and we&#8217;ll do it. well be on the look out! Something willie forgot to tell you was that, not only do you drown us, melt us, and such, but we dont like it when you stick your hands up our backs!</p>
<p>enjoy!</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>all the comments saying i woke up and saw my doll move and all are because when you stay up late or wake up in the night you may see shadows in dolls or people on your posters might make small movments or big ones this all depends in your leve of tiredness and this is your brain tricking you from a dream to reality (or even if you didnt have a dream) and it still thinks it can control what you see&#8230;</p>
<p>most ghost reports and storys are just fake mind images made from tiredness</p>
<p>hope this helps&#8230;..</p>

      <div class="commenttext"><p>I was driving home with my mom after we had just been at the store. I was sitting in the back seat while carrying an evil ventriloquist dummy named Slappy in my arms. While halfway home, I tried tossing Slappy out the car window, but he held onto the side of the car and climbed back in angrily. I begged him to forgive me and told him I was sorry. Then, when I got home, I locked him in my moms car and ran up on our porch and pointed and laughed at him while he stared at me in anger from the back seat window. Then, while I was laughing, he turned into a twinkling star, flew into my ass, turned back into his normal self, and said &#8220;IT&#8217;S SUPPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRR TIIIIIIIIIIIIME&#8221; in a very evil and sinister voice. He then began to devour all of the shit in my ass while making a &#8220;RARARARARARARARARARARARA&#8221; sound. This tickled my ass so much that I ran off the porch and began rubbing dirt in my face, which didn&#8217;t help anyway. Then, I woke up, and still haven&#8217;t forgotten the tickle that was inflicted upon my ass.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make the same mistake that I did by locking Slappy in a car, running up on a porch, and then proceeding to point and laugh at him. super bootyasscheeks jones of bootyassiousness ultimatum</p>
